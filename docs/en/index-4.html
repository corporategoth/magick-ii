<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 What is the Home Site of Magick?</A>
</H2>

<P>The Product home site is 
<A HREF="http://www.magick.tm">http://www.magick.tm</A><P>The Project home site is 
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/magick">http://sourceforge.net/projects/magick</A><P>Whats the difference?  The Product site only really deals with telling
people about Magick, and giving them a place to download it.  There is
help on the site, and links, but most of the content is static (not
changing) unless there is a new version.  There IS a news section, but
this is more general news.
<P>The Project site is where all bug tracking is done -- the newest (alpha
and beta) versions of the program are available from here, Forums for
which to discuss magick are hosted here, and a task list of what is to
be done in Magick is also contained on this site.  This site is very
dynamic and where you should go if you have questions, or problems
with magick -- or want to see whats coming up, or who is who.

<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 My IRCD isn't supported, what can I do?</A>
</H2>

<P>If this is the case, and none of the pre-defined IRCD's are
compatible with it, please find out exactly (at a server to server
protocol level) how your IRCD is different to the ones Magick supports
(or ask the IRCD's author) and email the list of differences to the
Magick Development Team 
<A HREF="mailto:devel@magick.tm">devel@magick.tm</A>.
<P>Here are some of the IRCD's we know are compatible with ones supported:

<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Why dont these services work right with Hybrid?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Hybrid has several key features missing from what many consider
a 'modern' ircd.  There is no way to remove a network-wide kill
(aka. GLINE), no way to rename a nickname on the network, no
way to set user modes on people, and probably weirdest of all,
users cannot OP themselves.  This means that many features that
people often expect from Magick are disabled.
<P>The most obvious thing many people will notice using Magick on
a hybrid network is that ChanServ, if set to join a channel,
will not OP itself -- mainly because it cant, it tries, but
hybrid rejects it.  Also all users who dont identify will be
killed, not renamed, and options like SETMODE (under CommServ
in the magick.ini file) will have no effect.
<P>Not much I can do about this, hybrid was NOT designed for use
with services, and it shows.  Hybrid, unlike alot of other IRCDs
is a 'paranoid' IRCD.  Most IRCD's out there will basically
say 'If I receive it, unless its syntactically wrong, its already
happened, so I cant reject it -- so I'll just deal with it'.
Hybrid says 'I am going to make sure its not only syntactically
correct, but that it adheres to all the rules I place on it'.

<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 I like these services and want to pay the author!</A>
</H2>

<P>OK, so this isn't something I hear, but a little wishful thinking
never hurts.  If you want to send me something by snail mail, then
feel free to do so to PO BOX 893, SUTHERLAND, NSW, 2232, Australia.
I always like tokens of appreciation, puts a smile on my face and
makes the whole thing worth while (no, not necessarily money, but
that is always nice!).  Remember tho, if you ARE going to send me
money, don't send cash, and ensure it is cashable in Australia (an
international postal order is usually best).
