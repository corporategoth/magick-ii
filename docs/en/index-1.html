<P>
<P>Magick IRC Services are a program that is designed to interface
with an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) network, and offer its users,
operators and administrators services such as the ability to
register nicknames so they cannot be taken by anyone else, the
ability to register channels with pre-defined access lists and
kick lists so that channels may not be taken over, the ability
to leave offline messages for other users, and many network
control mechanisms to stop things like flooding, abusive users,
and many other things.
<P>Magick services adhere to RFC 1459, and many variants of it.
The changes to the base protocol will not be discussed in this
document, as there are too many of them, and so many different
destinct protocols around nowdays, however Magick has been
designed to cope with them all, with a minimum of fuss (as long
as they support services of this nature).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Dedication</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Magick is dedicated to the memory of PreZ's loving sister,
Stacey Louise Elder (1st Jan, 1975 - 25th Feb, 1998). She
has been there for me more than anyone over the years, and I
was distraught when she died, may her Lord love her as much
as I did, and keep her safe like I could not. Merry Parting,
Dear Sister.
<P>Magick is also dedicated to the memory of Ungod's brother,
Edward Kevin King (28th Aug, 1982 - 21st Nov, 1997), His
life was short, but his memory is great, never will those
who knew him forget him.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Authors</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Magick is designed and developed by the Magick Development
Team 
<A HREF="mailto:magick-devel@magick.tm">magick-devel@magick.tm</A>.  Any bugs, feature requests,
comments, etc should be directed at this mailing list.  The
development team is an OPEN team, however certain skills
are required to join, not the least of which is the ability
to program in C and C++, and to use CVS.  To join this team,
please e-mail 
<A HREF="mailto:prez@magick.tm">prez@magick.tm</A> for further details.
<P>The Magick Alpha Team 
<A HREF="mailto:magick-alpha@magick.tm">magick-alpha@magick.tm</A> test current
development versions of Magick, finding not only bugs, but
also making sure it is a user friendly and understandable
product, so it may be changed at the same time its being
designed if needs be (rather than going back and re-writing
it).  The alpha team is an OPEN testing team, and you may
join it by first downloading and installing/setting up the
current alpha version of Magick (if you cannot do this on
your own, its recommended you do not join the alpha team),
and then e-mailing 
<A HREF="mailto:majordomo@magick.tm">majordomo@magick.tm</A> with "subscribe
magick-alpha" (no quotes, on one line).
<P>The Magick Beta Team 
<A HREF="mailto:magick-beta@magick.tm">magick-beta@magick.tm</A> test versions
of magick that have been through alpha testing, and are in
the final phase of development.  The beta team's main goal
is to find bugs before Magick is released, so they do not
get out into the release version of Magick.  The beta team
is an OPEN testing team, and you may join it by first down-
loading and installing/setting up the current beta version
of Magick, and then e-mailing 
<A HREF="mailto:majordomo@magick.tm">majordomo@magick.tm</A> with
"subscribe magick-beta" (no quotes, on one line).
