<sect>Introduction
<p>

Magick IRC Services are a program that is designed to interface
with an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) network, and offer its users,
operators and administrators services such as the ability to
register nicknames so they cannot be taken by anyone else, the
ability to register channels with pre-defined access lists and
kick lists so that channels may not be taken over, the ability
to leave offline messages for other users, and many network
control mechanisms to stop things like flooding, abusive users,
and many other things.

Magick services adhere to RFC 1459, and many variants of it.
The changes to the base protocol will not be discussed in this
document, as there are too many of them, and so many different
distinct protocols around nowadays, however Magick has been
designed to cope with them all, with a minimum of fuss (as long
as they support services of this nature).

<sect1>Dedication
<p>

Magick is dedicated to the memory of PreZ's loving sister,
Stacey Louise Elder (1st Jan, 1975 - 25th Feb, 1998). She
has been there for me more than anyone over the years, and I
was distraught when she died, may her Lord love her as much
as I did, and keep her safe like I could not. Merry Parting,
Dear Sister.

Magick is also dedicated to the memory of Ungod's brother,
Edward Kevin King (28th Aug, 1982 - 21st Nov, 1997), His
life was short, but his memory is great, never will those
who knew him forget him.

Magick is designed and developed by the Magick Development
Team <htmlurl url="mailto:devel@magick.tm" name="devel@magick.tm">.  Any bugs, feature requests,
comments, etc should be directed at this mailing list.  The
development team is an OPEN team, however certain skills
are required to join, not the least of which is the ability
to program in C and C++, and to use CVS.  To join this team,
please e-mail <htmlurl url="mailto:prez@magick.tm" name="prez@magick.tm"> for further details.

The Magick Alpha Team <htmlurl url="mailto:alpha@magick.tm" name="alpha@magick.tm"> test current
development versions of Magick, finding not only bugs, but
also making sure it is a user friendly and understandable
product, so it may be changed at the same time its being
designed if needs be (rather than going back and re-writing
it).  The alpha team is an OPEN testing team, and you may
join it by first downloading and installing/setting up the
current alpha version of Magick (if you cannot do this on
your own, its recommended you do not join the alpha team),
and then e-mailing <htmlurl url="mailto:majordomo@magick.tm" name="majordomo@magick.tm"> with "subscribe
alpha" (no quotes, on one line).

The Magick Beta Team <htmlurl url="mailto:beta@magick.tm" name="beta@magick.tm"> test versions
of magick that have been through alpha testing, and are in
the final phase of development.  The beta team's main goal
is to find bugs before Magick is released, so they do not
get out into the release version of Magick.  The beta team
is an OPEN testing team, and you may join it by first down-
loading and installing/setting up the current beta version
of Magick, and then e-mailing <htmlurl url="mailto:majordomo@magick.tm" name="majordomo@magick.tm"> with
"subscribe beta" (no quotes, on one line).

The following people have contributed to the final product
of Magick II (testers not included):

<sect2> Pre-Services 3.0
<p>

Originally, Magick was based on Services 2.2.26, by Andrew Church.
As of Magick II, they are no longer based in any way, shape or form
on these services.


<sect>Installation
<p>

<sect1>How to obtain Magick 
<p>

The Magick home page can be found at:
	<htmlurl url="http://www.magick.tm">

Magick is freely downloadable from:
	<htmlurl url="ftp://ftp.magick.tm/pub/Magick">

The Magick public mailing list is <htmlurl url="mailto:magick@magick.tm" name="magick@magick.tm">
To subscribe, email <htmlurl url="mailto:majordomo@magick.tm" name="majordomo@magick.tm"> with `subscribe
magick' (no quotes) in the text of the message.

<sect1>Requirements
<p>

To compile Magick, you will need a GOOD C++ compiler.  Ones that
have been tested and found to work are:
    <itemize>
    <item>gcc 2.95 and above
    <item>Borland C++ Builder 4.0 and above
    </itemize>
Others may work, but have NOT been tested.

Before you begin compilation of Magick, you must have a fully compiled
version of the Adaptive Communications Environment (ACE), the ZLIB
compression library, and a threads library such as pthreads.

If you are missing any of the above, you may obtain them as follows:
	<itemize>
	<item><htmlurl url="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html" name="ACE">
	<item><htmlurl url="ftp://ftp.freesoftware.com/pub/infozip/zlib/index.html" name="ZLIB">
	<item><htmlurl url="http://www.gnu.org/pth" name="PTH">
	</itemize>

FreeBSD USERS - FreeBSD has inbuilt its threads library into its
default operating system, and you do not need a separate threads
library, however all versions before 3.4 with the standard libc_r
patch from FreeBSD dated 02-02-2000, or 4.0 will not work, due to
a badly implemented threads library.

You must compile each of the above products before attempting to
build Magick.  Magick will look for them in the configure phase.

Also, if you dont have about 128mb memory (including swap), and 150mb
hard disk space free, I wouldnt bother to compile magick.  Our main
philosophy is to try and get Magick as efficiant at run-time as
possible, to this end, we've had to trade off compile-time resources
and resulting binary size.  What this means in english is, the final
product is very efficient, however making it will take a large
chunk out of your available resources.

Host locking (ie. stopping magick from being run anywhere that
doesnt have the same host and system type compiled into magick)
is impossible with pre-compiled binaries.  If you wish to add
this level of protection in (ie. you want to ensure that even
if someone DOES get your binaries, they cant run them without
going through some special measures to try and do so), then you
will need to re-compile.  Essentially the rule of thumb is
'compile if you can, use pre-compiled binaries if you must'.

<sect1>ACE Installation
<p>

Please note:  If you do not want to compile ACE yourself, or you
are having troubles compiling it, pre-compiled binaries of ACE are
available from ftp://ftp.magick.tm/pub/magick.tm/ace.  It is
recommended you get the 'shared' version first, and 'static' only
if the shared does not work.  If your OS is not listed, please
contact the <htmlurl url="mailto:devel@magick.tm" name="Magick Development Team">.
Above and beyong this help file, we will not help you compile ACE.

I've included this section now because people seem to have troubles
installing the ACE library obtained above.  One special note for
people wanting to install ACE.  Do NOT use the `configure' utility.
This utility is still in its infancy for ACE, and tends not to work.

Instead, you should follow the instructions that are outlined in the
ACE-INSTALL file, which is simply (from the ACE_wrappers directory):

<tscreen><verb>
export ACE_ROOT=$PWD
cd ace
ls config*    (find the one for your system)
ln -s config-your-system.h config.h
cd ..
cd include/makeinclude
ls platform*    (find the one for your system)
ln -s platform_your_system.GNU platform_macros.GNU
cd ../..
make
</verb></tscreen>

<itemize>
<item>Linux Note: All linux systems with kernel versions 2.2.0 and beyond
should use the lxpthread linux configuration.
<item>FreeBSD Note: You should use the pthread version of this library
if you hope to use it with Magick.  Please read FreeBSD note above.
</itemize>

Note on the above.  The `export ACE_ROOT=' command may not work on
your shell.  csh and tcsh users will have to use `set ACE_ROOT=',
and on some other weird shells, just `ACE_ROOT='.  Try them until
you get one that doesn't error.  Once you have one that doesn't have
an error, just type `echo $ACE_ROOT' to ensure it gives you your
current directory, if not, keep trying.  I love unix standards :)

Note, If you get problems in the make with errors like:

ACE_wrappers/include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU,
       line 135: Missing dependency operator

Your version of make is either old or not GNU standard.  ACE requires
a GNU standard make program to compile.  First see if the program
`gmake' exists, and if so try it, if not, or it doesn't work, please
download it by going to http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html
and downloading it from one of their mirror sites.  Incase your
wondering `do I need root for this?'  No, you don't.  Just download
it, compile it, and then type:

alias make=/path/to/make-x.y/make

Where /path/to are replaced with the full path before the make
directory (eg. /home/myuser), and the x and y in the make-x.y
directory are substituted for the version of make you have.  Once
you have aliased make, then try and build ACE again.

After ACE has been made, you have two options:

<itemize>
<item>As root, you can copy *.so in the ace directory to /usr/local/lib
   and then copy *.h, *.i, *.inl and *.cpp in the ace directory to
   /usr/local/include/ace, which you will have to create.  On linux
   systems you will have to type 'ldconfig' after this.  Don't forget
   to make the libs chmod 755, and the includes chmod 644.
<item>When you don't have root, use the --with-acelib and --with-aceinc
   options to Magick's configure script to tell it where ACE is.
   Please note however, you will have to type the following line
   before you will be able to execute Magick:
</itemize>

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/ACE_wrappers/ace

Obviously the /path/to should be replaced with the full path leading
up to the ACE_wrappers directory (eg. /home/myuser).  The same note
above about `export ACE_ROOT=' applies to the above export.

<sect1>Basic Installation
<p>

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  <itemize>
  <item>`cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  <item>Type `make' to compile the package.

  <item>Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  <item>Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  <item>You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.
  </itemize>

<sect1>Compilers and Options
<p>

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
this:
     CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
     env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure

<sect1>Compiling For Multiple Architectures
<p>

   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

   If you have to use a `make' that does not supports the `VPATH'
variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a time
in the source code directory.  After you have installed the package for
one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring for another
architecture.

<sect1>Installation Names
<p>

   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PATH'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `--bindir=PATH' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

<sect1>Optional Features
<p>

   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
package recognises.

   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.

<sect1>Specifying the System Type
<p>

   There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host the package
will run on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
a message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
`--host=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:
     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
need to know the host type.

   If you are building compiler tools for cross-compiling, you can also
use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will
produce code for and the `--build=TYPE' option to select the type of
system on which you are compiling the package.

<sect1>Sharing Defaults
<p>

   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.

<sect1>Operation Controls
<p>

   `configure' recognises the following options to control how it
operates.

<descrip>
<tag/--cache-file=FILE/
     Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
     `./config.cache'.  Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for
     debugging `configure'.

<tag/--help/
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

<tag/--quiet
--silent
-q/
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
     messages will still be shown).

<tag/--srcdir=DIR/
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

<tag/--version/
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

<tag/--with-acelib=file
--with-aceinc=path/
     This specifies where the makefile should look for the ACE library
file, and its includes respectively.  You must specify full pathnames.
Verification on what you have entered is minimal (ie. will only verify
the existence of the library file, and OS.h in the include directory).
This should only be used if Magick does not detect the ACE library.

<tag/--with-zlib=file
--with-zinc=path/
     This specifies where the makefile should look for the ZLIB library
file, and its includes respectively.  You must specify full pathnames.
Verification on what you have entered is minimal (ie. will only verify
the existence of the library file, and zlib.h in the include directory).
This should only be used if Magick does not detect the ZLIB library.

<tag/--enable-bsdthreads/
     This is mutually exclusive of --with-threadlib and --with-threadinc,
it specifies to use the -pthreads option with GCC or CC when linking the
magick binary.  This is used for systems where pthreads is ingrained in
the standard C library, specifically, BSD.

<tag/--with-threadlib=file
--with-threadinc=path/
     This specifies where the makefile should look for a threads library
file, and its includes respectively.  You must specify full pathnames.
Verification on what you have entered is minimal (ie. will only verify
the existence of the library file, and the include directory exists).
This should only be used if Magick does not detect a threads library.

<tag/--with-locknode=node
--with-locktype=type
--with-lockrel=rel/
     This will set the host lock values (see --enable-hostlock below)
for the purpose of building a locked binary for another system.  This
is mainly for people who want to run magick on a system that is not
capable of compiling it, but dont want to use an unlocked binary.  The
best way to to do this is after the configuration process, type 'make
ace_uname' and then execute ace_uname, the value on the 2nd line is the
node, the value on the 1st and 5th line are the type and should be
seperated by a `/' character (ie. 1st/5th).  The value of the 3rd line
is the rel.  Alternatively, you can try using the commands `uname -n'
for the 2nd line, `uname -s' for the 1st line, `uname -m' for the 5th
line, and `uname -r' for the 3rd line, but it is recommended you use
ace_uname instead (as the values may not match on some systems!).
NOTE: the release is currently not used in hostlock protection.

<tag/--with-include=path
--with-libdir=path
--with-lib=lib/
     These will add -I, -L and -l options to the compile/link options.
If you find Magick wont compile on your system due to missing symbols,
or undefined references, it may not have been able to find a header it
needed, or it may not have included a required library.  The include
and libdir should both be directories where to find the include files
or libraries, where lib should be the library name with the lib prefix
and the .so or .a postfix truncated.  eg. libpthread.so becomes pthread.

<tag/--enable-static
--disable-static/
     This determines weather the resulting Magick binaries will be
linked statically or dynamically.  Static binaries are larger than
dynamic, but may be taken across differing releases (of the same
operating system) without regard for what specific version of things
such as the C libraries are installed.  Static binaries require that
a static ACE, threads and zlib library exist to link with.  Dynamic
binaries may only be used on systems that have the same library
setup as the one they were compiled on, and because they dont include
all the extra stuff needed to statically link, are much smaller.

<tag/--enable-quick
--disable-quick/
     This turns off the call to 'helper/build-ver' which increments
the build number displayed in Magick's version reply.  This is only
useful if you plan to compile alot, and dont want to have to re-
compile the entire program each time you make a change, however it
means you will not have an accurate build number indication.

<tag/--enable-test
--disable-test/
     This creates testing binaries of Magick.  Test binaries will not
communicate through a socket, but instead will read all input from
standard input, and send all output to standard output.  With this
mode, you can play back certain test scenarios, to try and catch a
specific bug, or just verify the code still works as it should.

<tag/--enable-crypt
--disable-crypt/
     This turns on or off encryption support in Magick.  Some versions
of Magick may not be distributed with encryption, in which case you
will have to download it and enable it to use it.  The encryption of
choice right now is 3BF (3 * blowfish).

<tag/--enable-trace
--disable-trace/
     This turns on or off the internal tracing functions of Magick.  This
can cause problems right now with large databases.  It is therefore by
default disabled.  It does however allow debugging of Magick without
the need or use of core file analysis.

<tag/--enable-convert
--disable-convert/
     This enables or disables the --convert commandline paramater that
can be used to convert older versions of Magick DB's or other services
databases.  Not needed for normal running of magick.

<tag/--enable-getpass
--disable-getpass/
     This enables the ChanServ and NickServ GETPASS commands, as opposed
to the default SETPASS commands.  By doing this, passwords will be stored
as they are in the database.  This is disabled by default, which means
only SETPASS is available, and passwords are stored in a one-way hash
that makes it impossible to retrieve passwords.

<tag/--enable-locks
--disable-locks/
     This turns on or off thread locking.  Thread locking is essential
for ensuring only one thread can access a bit of data at once.  On some
bad thread implementations, this will stop segfaults, however it is a
big target asking for data corruption turning this off.

<tag/--enable-hostlock
--disable-hostlock/
     This will enable or disable host and system type checking on startup.
When enabled, if the binary is moved to a system where the hostname or
system specs are different from where the binary was compiled, it will
fail to operate, and a re-compile will be necessary.  This is enabled by
default, however if you want to create a portable binary (that can be
used anywhere) disable this option.  This is a security feature to protect
against people copying your services directory (binaries and all) and
stealing the databases.  This is not infallable, however it does help.
Disabling this will also disable automatic binary 'stamping' (ie.
putting random keys for keyfile encryption at compile time).  It is
assumed that you are making a binary ment to be portable and/or
distributed, in which case, the binaries should be stamped by the
end-user (or on each system it is deployed).

<tag/--enable-mpatrol
--disable-mpatrol/
     This turns on or off the usage of the memory error checking and
profiling software mpatrol (http://www.cbmamiga.demon.co.uk/mpatrol).
This software is useful in the fact it looks for memory access errors
(eg. accessing unitialised memory, exceeding memory bounds, not freeing
memory, etc).  However it slows the program down dramatically.  Turning
this on causes a new log file (mpatrol.log) to be created.

<tag/--enable-efence
--disable-efence/
     This turns on or off the usage of the memory error checking and
profiling software Electric Fence (http://ftp://ftp.perens.com/pub/ElectricFence).
This software is useful in the fact it looks for memory access errors
(eg. accessing unitialised memory, exceeding memory bounds, not freeing
memory, etc).  However it slows the program down dramatically.  Turning
this on causes the program to stop at the first memory problem (so it
is recommended you run this in a debugger).
</descrip>

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.

<sect1>Security Tips
<p>

     Magick has several facilities to ensure your databases and inter-
magick communications are kept secure and encrypted.  The main methods
of facilitating this are:
     <itemize>
     <item>Databases and inter-magick communication is encrypted with a
       key through 3BF.  This key resides in a key file.
     <item>The key file itself is encrypted with two keys generated at
       compile time, to ensure the key file is never clear text.
     <item>EACH compile creates new key file keys, which means you must
       re-generate the key file each time you compile, ensuring it
       does not get stale (and becomes invalid if someone gets it!)
     <item>You may manually replace the key file keys by using the
       magick_stampkeys utility that comes with magick (you will have
       to regenerate your key file after this).
     </itemize>

To ensure the security of your databases and communication, you should
     <itemize>
     <item>Chose a long and complex database key, you must remember this
       somehow, incase you need to generate a new database key, however
       you wont need it often.
     <item>Use the magick_stampkeys utility on all your binaries at once
       and regenerate your keys every so often, so stop them becoming
       stale.
     </itemize>

Windows users will not automatically generate a new keyset with each
compile.  It is recommended you create your own using the magick_stampkeys
utility supplied if you intend to use encryption.  This must be
done some time before the database encryption key is generated.

Syntax for the magick_stampkeys utility is:
<tscreen><verb>
     magick_stampkeys <all binaries to be stamped>
</verb></tscreen>

You MUST do all executable files at once, so an example is:
<tscreen><verb>
     (UNIX) magick_stampkeys magick magick.debug magick_keygen
     (WIN ) magick_stampkeys magick.exe magick_keygen.exe
</verb></tscreen>

Keep in mind that to be able to stamp a binary, it must NOT have been
previously stamped, so you will need a 'freshly linked' file.  All
binary distributions contain un-stamped files, all source distributions
can create (and auto-restamp) files with the "make reilnk" command.

REMEMBER:  If you forget your database password, then you had BETTER
decrypt your databases (via. the config file) ASAP, as if you lose
your key, and do not know the password to generate a new one, you
may as well remove the file and start again.

Pre-compiled binaries will not be able to change the key file keys.
This could be considered an advantage of compiling yourself.

<sect> Usage <p>

<sect1>Support files
<p>

All files and directories listed are relative to the current
'Services Directory'. The services directory is set with the
--dir command line option. If none is specified, it will default
to the current directory.

<descrip>
<tag/magick.ini/ This file is included with your Magick distribution
in the docs directory.  This file must either be specified on the
command line with the --config option, or in the services directory.
This file contains all settings that Magick II will use throughout
its execution (these can be changed and reloaded online).

<tag/magick.mnd/ This is the Magick New Datafile (or mound) file.  This
stores all data that is stored by Magick.  This file is not human
readable, and is often encrypted and/or compressed.  This filename
is a setting in the magick.ini file, and may be changed.  This file
will be created if it does not exist.

<tag/magick.log/ This is the log file which logs all activity of note
that happens inside Magick.  The verbosity of this log file can
vary depending on the --debug option, or the VERBOSE config option.
This file may be zeroed without any decremental effects, or if
it is removed, the OFF and ON online commands will re-establish
the filehandle. This filename is a setting in the magick.ini file,
and may be changed.  This file is created if it doesn't exist.

<tag/magick.pid/ This file indicates the process ID of the currently
running Magick on UNIX-based systems.  This may be used to easily
determine if Magick is running, and to kill a running copy. This
filename is a setting in the magick.ini file, and may be changed.
This file is overwritten on Magick startup.

<tag/magick.motd/ This contains the text of the server motd that will
be displayed to any user who types /MOTD services.server in their
IRC client. This filename is a setting in the magick.ini file, and
may be changed.

<tag/magick.key/ This contains the key for your databases, encrypted.
This key file should be generated with magick_keygen.  This file
may not be used by more than one set of services (unless the binaries
are copied), as each compile requires regenerating this file.  This
filename is a setting in the magick.ini file, and may be changed.

<tag/lang/ This directory is where all language files (*.lng, *.lfo and
*.hlp) will be stored.  The path name actually used is a setting
in the magick.ini file.

<tag/lang\*.lng/ These files contain the responses Magick will send back
to users for any command, or output from any procedure.  These files
are 'tokenised', and are substituted with actual values.  The default
language file to used is set by the DEF_LANGUAGE parameter in the
magick.ini file, however languages may be set per-user.

<tag/lang\*.lfo/ These files contain the log file outputs Magick will
use for all messages going to the magick.log file.  These files are
'tokenised', and are substituted with actual values.  The file that
is used is set by the DEF_LANGUAGE parameter in the magick.ini file.

<tag/lang\*.hlp/ These files contain the help text that Magick uses to
respond to all HELP commands.  The default help file used is set by
the DEF_LANGUAGE parameter in the magick.ini file, however languages
may be set per-user.

<tag/files\pic/ This directory is where all user's pictures are stored.
The files themselves are stored as hexadecimal numbers, with no
extension -- the map to real filenames is stored in the database.
The path name actually used is a setting in the magick.ini file.

<tag/files\memo/ This directory is where all attachments are stored.
The files themselves are stored as hexadecimal numbers, with no
extension -- the map to real filenames is stored in the database.
The path name actually used is a setting in the magick.ini file.

<tag/files\public/ This directory is where all files in the public
filesystem are stored.
The files themselves are stored as hexadecimal numbers, with no
extension -- the map to real filenames is stored in the database.
The path name actually used is a setting in the magick.ini file.

<tag/files\temp/ This directory is where all files involved in DCC
transfers (sending or receiving) are stored.  These files are
considered volatile, and if Magick is not running, can safely be
removed. The files themselves are stored as hexadecimal numbers,
with no extension. The path name actually used is a setting in the
magick.ini file.
</descrip>

<sect1> General Usage
<p>

Magick once started, becomes a background process.  It accepts
a number of command-line options that override the settings of
their equivalents on load.  NOTE: If the config file is loaded
again at runtime, the settings in the config file will be used.

<tscreen><verb>
--help (or -?)	Help output (summary of the below).
--dir X		Set the initial services directory.
--config X	Set the name (and/or path) of the config file.
--nofork	Do not become a daemon/service process (dont fork()).
--service X     Manipulate Magick's NT Service settings, where X is:
                        insert (insert Magick into service db)
                        start (start Magick, must be a service)
                        stop (stop Magick, must be a service)
                        remove (remove Magick from service db)
		This option is not valid on non-Windows installations.
--convert X	Convert another version of services databases
		to Magick II format, where X is the type of
		database to convert.  Currently recognised:
			magick (1.4)   esper (4.4.8)
			epona (1.4.7)  sirc (N/A)
		MUST BE COMPILED INTO BINARY TO BE AVAILABLE.
--trace X:Y	Set the trace level on startup, equivalent of
		using the OperServ TRACE SET command while
		running, where X is the trace type (or ALL), and
		Y is the trace level in hex.
		MUST BE COMPILED INTO BINARY TO BE AVAILABLE.
</verb></tscreen>

All other command line options just override the configuration
file settings.  Below is a list of the overrides available, and
the settings they override in the configuration file.  Please see
the configuration file's comments for more information on each
option, and what it does.

<tscreen><verb>
PARAMETER	SHORT	GROUP		OPTION
---------	-----	-----		------
--name X	-n	STARTUP		SERVER_NAME
--desc X	-d	STARTUP		SERVER_DESC

--inflight X	-f	MEMOSERV	INFLIGHT
--logignore	-i	OPERSERV	LOG_IGNORE=true
--ignore X      -I	OPERSERV	IGNORE_METHOD
</verb></tscreen>

Example:

<tscreen><verb>
./magick --config /etc/magick.ini
</verb></tscreen>

After Magick is running, it should be totally driven through the
on-line clients (NickServ, ChanServ, OperServ, etc).  However,
in certain cases, events happen and these interfaces are either
not available, not responding, too slow, or don't recognise you.
For this eventuality, all UNIX SIGNALS have been trapped, and
some perform extra functions that 'originally' intended.

<tscreen><verb>
SIGNAL	NUMBER	EQUIVALENT	DESCRIPTION
------	------	----------	-----------
SIGHUP	1	OS RELOAD	Re-loads the config file.
SIGINT	2	OS SIGNON	Attempts to sign on all clients.
SIGPIPE	13	IGNORE		Flushes trace output immediately.
SIGTERM	15	OS UPDATE	Saves the databases.
SIGCHLD	17	IGNORE		Check to see if we're alive.
</verb></tscreen>

Some have queried me on why SIGTERM saves the databases.  During
shutdown of many systems, the shutdown scripts will send a SIGTERM
to all running processes, wait a while, then send a SIGKILL (9).
This gives us a chance to save our databases before we're killed.
This also means that you must use kill -KILL (kill -9) to kill
Magick once it has been started.

To use encryption, you must generate a key file with the program
magick_keygen.  This program accepts a maximum of one argument,
being the output key filename.  If no argument is supplied, it
will ask you to enter the filename interactively.

On unix terminals that support it, the text entered at the key
prompts will be hidden, however to not bank on this, and always
ensure no one can look over your shoulder of sniff your network
traffic to find out what the clear-text password is.

Example:

<tscreen><verb>
./magick_keygen

<sect1>Functionality
<p>

Magick has 6 main services, and offers the ability to script either
added functionality to these existing services, or create totally
new services through its scripting language.  This section gives an
overview of the main functionality and purpose of the hard-coded
services.  Please note, the actual nicknames of each of the below
services may be different on each network.

NickServ is a services that allows users to register their IRC
nicknames so that no one else may take them.  Users may then set
various options on their nickname record, such as privacy mode,
kill protection, etc that affect the way their nickname is
treated, and how services respond to them.  They may also set
purely informational fields in their nickname record they is
displayed on an INFO request.  NickName registration is required
to execute many other commands in services, be added to a channel
access list, or receive memos from other users.

ChanServ is a service that allows users to register a channel on
the IRC network, so that they may specify who has access to them,
and who shall be automatically kicked from them.  This not only
prevents such things as channel takeovers, but establishes a
definite 'seniority' system in the channel.  ChanServ also allows
users to set various options on their channel records, from the
purely informational that is displayed in an INFO request, to
options that change the behaviour of services, and how users are
treated in a channel.  This service also offers such features as
on-join greetings, user-based greetings, etc.

MemoServ is a service that allows users to send memos to other
users, or post news articles to channels.  This service also
allows such features as forwarding, or replying to memos, and
even attaching files via. DCC to memos (to other users only).
This service also integrates with NickServ's ignore list, and
ChanServ's access list to vary the ability to send, or read
memos or news articles.

CommServ is a service that maintains 'committees' or groups of
users.  These groups can be simply a list of users who have a
common interest, or can alter a user's access to certain features
of services.  You may also send memos to all members of a committee
or set logon messages for committees that all members will see
on signon.  Services has 6 'default' committees:
	<descrip>
	<tag/SADMIN/ Services Administrators - Members of this
		  committee are hard-coded into the Magick
		  configuration file.
	<tag/SOP/ Services Operators - Members of this committee
		  are added by members of the SADMIN committee.
	<tag/ADMIN/ Server Administrators - Members of this committee
		  are added by members of the SADMIN committee.
	<tag/OPER/ IRC Operators - Members of this committee are
		  added by members of the ADMIN committee.
	<tag/REGD/ All Registered Users - This committee may not be
		  modified, and its members are dynamic.
	<tag/ALL/ All Users - This committee may not be modified,
		  and its members are dynamic.
	</descrip>

OperServ is a services that allows IRC Operators to keep control
on the network.  This service offers functions like an Automatic
Kill list, Clone Protection (and overriding), Services Ignore,
IRC Operator Denying, as well as the ability to JUPE (fake-link)
a server, change a user or channels modes, and many more functions.

ServMsg is mainly an informational service, users may get help,
statistics and information about services, and the network they
are connected to from this service.  This service also offers the
ability for Server Administrators to send a global message that
will be sent to all users on the network, and services operators
to offer files to users through the public file system.

<sect>Questions and Answers<p>

<sect1>What is the Home Site of Magick?<p>
The Product home site is <htmlurl url="http://www.magick.tm">

The Project home site is <htmlurl url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/magick">

Whats the difference?  The Product site only really deals with telling
people about Magick, and giving them a place to download it.  There is
help on the site, and links, but most of the content is static (not
changing) unless there is a new version.  There IS a news section, but
this is more general news.

The Project site is where all bug tracking is done -- the newest (alpha
and beta) versions of the program are available from here, Forums for
which to discuss magick are hosted here, and a task list of what is to
be done in Magick is also contained on this site.  This site is very
dynamic and where you should go if you have questions, or problems
with magick -- or want to see whats coming up, or who is who.


<sect1>My IRCD isn't supported, what can I do?<p>
   If this is the case, and none of the pre-defined IRCD's are
compatible with it, please find out exactly (at a server to server
protocol level) how your IRCD is different to the ones Magick supports
(or ask the IRCD's author) and email the list of differences to the
Magick Development Team <htmlurl url="mailto:devel@magick.tm" name="devel@magick.tm">.

Here are some of the IRCD's we know are compatible with ones supported:
<tscreen><verb>

<sect1>Why dont these services work right with Hybrid?<p>

Hybrid has several key features missing from what many consider
a 'modern' ircd.  There is no way to remove a network-wide kill
(aka. GLINE), no way to rename a nickname on the network, no
way to set user modes on people, and probably weirdest of all,
users cannot OP themselves.  This means that many features that
people often expect from Magick are disabled.

The most obvious thing many people will notice using Magick on
a hybrid network is that ChanServ, if set to join a channel,
will not OP itself -- mainly because it cant, it tries, but
hybrid rejects it.  Also all users who dont identify will be
killed, not renamed, and options like SETMODE (under CommServ
in the magick.ini file) will have no effect.

Not much I can do about this, hybrid was NOT designed for use
with services, and it shows.  Hybrid, unlike alot of other IRCDs
is a 'paranoid' IRCD.  Most IRCD's out there will basically
say 'If I receive it, unless its syntactically wrong, its already
happened, so I cant reject it -- so I'll just deal with it'.
Hybrid says 'I am going to make sure its not only syntactically
correct, but that it adheres to all the rules I place on it'.

<sect1>I like these services and want to pay the author!<p>
   OK, so this isn't something I hear, but a little wishful thinking
never hurts.  If you want to send me something by snail mail, then
feel free to do so to PO BOX 893, SUTHERLAND, NSW, 2232, Australia.
I always like tokens of appreciation, puts a smile on my face and
makes the whole thing worth while (no, not necessarily money, but
that is always nice!).  Remember tho, if you ARE going to send me
money, don't send cash, and ensure it is cashable in Australia (an
international postal order is usually best).

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for non-commercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgement or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.
