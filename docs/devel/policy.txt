Magick Development Team Policy

Written as of Magick II.

* ALL full releases should compile with NO errors or and minimal
 (unavoidable) warnings on ANY supported platform.

* Alpha releases are to be released in the design phase of
  any release, for the alpha team to supply feedback of how
  the core design could be changed, enhanced, etc.  This
  includes the user interface (or proposed one) as well as the
  internal data structures, etc.
  ALPHA TEAM: The code here is guarenteed to be incomplete.

* Beta releases are to be released before ALL releases.
  There can be (and usually will be) more than one beta release.
  These are for the beta team to test out new features, etc and
  supply feedback on any bugs found.  The object of this team is
  to ensure no bugs get into full releases.  Beta releases will
  be released after each major 'module' of code is completed.

* A full release may not be released until AT LEAST 1 week (the
  more time the better) has passed since the last beta release.

* Patches are only to be released on full releases, and must only
  contain BUG FIXES -- never any new features unless it in itself
  is a bug fix.

* The magick version number should always have a +aX or +bX code
  appended to the end of it on Alpha and Beta releases.  Patches
  to full release versions will always append a +pX.

* Read/Write access to the central CVS archive may only EVER be
  given to official Magick Development Team members.

* Magick must ALWAYS be backward compatable -- any new features
  must be able to upgrade any data files from any old version
  of magick.  Magick's preferred way to do this is transperantly.
  However if they totally conflict of bloat code too much, and
  conversion utility is acceptable, however code must be internal
  to Magick to inform the end-user of magick that it is required
  to run this conversion utility to run this version of magick.

* Always at least try and get you're compiles working before you
  commit to the repository. Reasonable fubars will be understood
  in the normal case of things, but code which has not even had an
  attempt to compile at will be frowned upon if not thrown right
  back out.
