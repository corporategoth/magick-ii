=================

This is a 'requested' feature list from other people, or ideas
we've thought up ourselves.  With comments about other things
that will need to be done in order to acomodate each feature.
If 'approved' it will be moved to the main TODO.

* Proposed suggestion
+ Being worked on
- Totally Unfeasable
= Should be scripted
x Done
> Comment

* Show max peak in last X amount of time (say last day, 3 days & week)
  > Mebbe even be able to see graphical representations via. the web as
    a Magick plugin (now theres an idea, plugins for magick).  Might be
    better scripted tho.
= Work out some form of database redundancy (maybe backup copies) so
  that if we get a fucked up database, all aint lost. (credit skold).
  > I'd say this should be a shell script (Multipal versions of magick
    will also accomodate this).
= Ability to have logs go to a specified channel on the server
  eg (#services) (credit skold).
  > Scripted hook into 'LogOutput'?
- Memo recall, ie, being able to delete unread memos you've sent to people.
* If a misconfigured server fights with services (ie a missing uline) have
  services go into a sort of standby mode, requiring any ircop to re enable
  them once the server has been fixed or removed (and leave certain commands
  like jupe active if the servers admin isnt around)
  > Personally, I think this is a bad idea, squit the server.
* Add a function to helpserv to forward messages to helpops

* Restart command in OperServ.
* Log and announce new max users (optional).
* Support specific ip (ie. our ip) selection (if system has it).
* Limit memos per user/channel (user definable with system max).
* Limit registered channels per user.
* Enforce time delay between allowing memo send.
* Enforce time delay between allowing nick/channel registrations.
* AKICK should be triggered if a user does /nick and suddenly matches.
* Ability to 'rename' a channel (eg. #aic -> #lucida).
* Have AKILL check online to ensure they are not akilling anyone on
  a committee higher than themselves.
