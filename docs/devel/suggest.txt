=================

This is a 'requested' feature list from other people, or ideas
we've thought up ourselves.  With comments about other things
that will need to be done in order to acomodate each feature.
If 'approved' it will be moved to the main TODO.

* Proposed suggestion
+ Being worked on
- Totally Unfeasable
= Should be scripted
x Done
> Comment

* Show max peak in last X amount of time (say last day, 3 days & week)
  > Mebbe even be able to see graphical representations via. the web as
    a Magick plugin (now theres an idea, plugins for magick).  Might be
    better scripted tho.
  > This would probably be part of a much more advanced stats system,
    for this, we would need db storage, and per second stats that can
    be gathered -- and of course, how long to keep them is a problem.

* If a misconfigured server fights with services (ie a missing uline) have
  services go into a sort of standby mode, requiring any ircop to re enable
  them once the server has been fixed or removed (and leave certain commands
  like jupe active if the servers admin isnt around)
  > Personally, I think this is a bad idea, squit the server.

* 'Insufficiant Paramaters' should also have syntax :)
  > BIG problems with language compatability, etc.  BIG mess.

* Should be able to akill on setting of topic containing wildcarded text.
  > MAJOR potential for being abused!  eg. if you akill on '/server ' then
    you will also akill anyone announcing their own server on the same net.
    Better off with a 'topic forbid' changing topics forcibly.

* Should be able to have permanent akills
  > Dont like this personally coz I've seen it abused (ie. not cleaned up).

* Log and announce new max users (optional) -- possibly store values.
  > As with previous point, should be part of a more advanced stats system.

* Limit memos per user/channel (user definable with system max).

* Ability to 'rename' a channel (eg. #aic -> #lucida).

* Have AKILL check online to ensure they are not akilling anyone on
  a committee 'higher' than themselves.

* Ability to have CS on-join messages go to only people NOT on the access
  list.
  > This is what channel news is for.  Possibly expand news to allow
    you to specify a level as to who can read the news.

* Expand the clone system to allow user@host clone protection, whith
  backup @host clone protection (say 2 per user@host, and 5 per @host).
  With allowances to override either.
  > Becomes difficult because a user@host clone override should not effect
    an @host clone limit -- so 8 users from one user@host should not stop
    another user from the same @host signing on.

* Have a per-channel 'bad words' list that will kick on mention of them
  > Requires chanserv to be in channel, or epona-style 'botserv'.  I
    dislike the idea of botserv in main services, so will prollie end
    up leaving this to the scripting language.

* Periodic require nickname password changes.  ie. after X time, user is
  told they have X time to chose a new password.  If the grace period
  expires without a password change, then it will be changed to a random
  password, and must be get/setpassed by a SOP.

* ChanServ 'verbose' mode, that informs all ops in channel that certain
  things have happened (ie. access adds/removes/changes, settings changes,
  etc).  Requested by PFAK, seen on DALnet services.
