=================

This is a 'requested' feature list from other people, or ideas
we've thought up ourselves.  With comments about other things
that will need to be done in order to acomodate each feature.
If 'approved' it will be moved to the main TODO.

* Proposed suggestion
+ Being worked on
- Totally Unfeasable
= Should be scripted
x Done
> Comment

* Show max peak in last X amount of time (say last day, 3 days & week)
  > Mebbe even be able to see graphical representations via. the web as
    a Magick plugin (now theres an idea, plugins for magick).  Might be
    better scripted tho.
= Work out some form of database redundancy (maybe backup copies) so
  that if we get a fucked up database, all aint lost. (credit skold).
  > I'd say this should be a shell script (Multipal versions of magick
    will also accomodate this).
  > Currently we create a 'old' file while saving a 'new' file, only when
    the save is done, do we move the 'new' file to the correct filename
    and THEN delete the old file, so essentially if an 'old' file exists
    and a new file exists, remove the new file and copy the old file as
    the databses.  If an old file exists and no new file does, remove it.
= Ability to have logs go to a specified channel on the server
  eg (#services) (credit skold).
  > Scripted hook into 'LogOutput'?
* If a misconfigured server fights with services (ie a missing uline) have
  services go into a sort of standby mode, requiring any ircop to re enable
  them once the server has been fixed or removed (and leave certain commands
  like jupe active if the servers admin isnt around)
  > Personally, I think this is a bad idea, squit the server.
* Add a function to helpserv to forward messages to helpops
* 'Insufficiant Paramaters' should also have syntax :)
* Should have a way to akill if nickname matches mask, or realname
  contains wildcarded text (akill would be added as default ignore mask)
* Should be able to akill on setting of topic containing wildcarded text.
  > MAJOR potential for being abused!
* Should be able to have permanent akills
  > Dont like this personally coz I've seen it abused.
* Restart command in OperServ.
* Log and announce new max users (optional) -- possibly store values.
* Limit memos per user/channel (user definable with system max).
* Ability to 'rename' a channel (eg. #aic -> #lucida).
* Have AKILL check online to ensure they are not akilling anyone on
  a committee higher than themselves.
