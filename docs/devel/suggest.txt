=================

This is a 'requested' feature list from other people, or ideas
we've thought up ourselves.  With comments about other things
that will need to be done in order to acomodate each feature.

* Proposed suggestion
+ Being worked on
- Totally Unfeasable
= Should be scripted
x Done
> Comment

x File hold capability on MemoServ (With definable max files/bytes).
  eg. /MSG MemoServ FILE nick filename [description]
  and /MSG MemoServ GET 1   (just like READ, but only works for files).
  Shows up in LIST as a file attachment, and when doing a READ ALL, it
  will show the filename, and the description.  Also tells anyone trying
  to send a file that the file quota is full for that user if it is.
  > We will have to store all files as something like files/00000001 or
    something, and keep a database of file #'s -> filenames (and who its for)
  > We'll have to work on DCC SEND file name <--> MS FILE command matching.
    We will also need a timeout (notice GET aborted due to timeout).
  > Will not have RESUME ability -- if it dont complete, its removed.
  > MUST have a SOP file removal command, and ability to resolve number to
    filename/user for sop's (so they can remove larger files).
x MS PREVIEW command.  Works like LIST, but shows FIRST x chars of memo.
* OS SECUREOPER - deoper people who are not on the services OPER committee.
x OS SECURE - cannot access operserv unless you're ON services OPER /
  ADMIN / SOP / SADMIN committees.
* Show max peak in last X amount of time (say last day, 3 days & week)
  > Mebbe even be able to see graphical representations via. the web as
    a Magick plugin (now theres an idea, plugins for magick).  Might be
    better scripted tho.
x Ability to have *long* memos, some way of getting round ircd's line length
  limitations.  Have a /MSG MemoServ continue command just appends to the last
  memo sent by that person (timeout ...?).
  > Also might be an idea to have a notification of a truncated memo (ie. it
    tells you 'Memo truncated, last text was "am hoping you will all agr".
    Type /MS continue to continue memo').  This would mean we'd have to set
    the 'Max memo size' to less than the IRCD limit so we can do the truncation,
    and let the user know it was truncated (else we'll RECEIVE it truncated).
    eg. 400 chars MAX per memo (text only here), and it will get truncated, and
    we show them the last say 20 chars of the memo they sent.
  > This will mean putting in a DELAY on sending memos so that they only get
    sent when the 'continue' timeout has expired.  Continue ability is removed
    on send of next memo, or say a /MS cancel command.
  > How about /msg memoserv startmsg     /msg memoserv endmessage timeout of half hour = auto send
= Work out some form of database redundancy (maybe backup copies) so
  that if we get a fucked up database, all aint lost. (credit skold).
  > I'd say this should be a shell script (Multipal versions of magick
    will also accomodate this).
= Ability to have logs go to a specified channel on the server
  eg (#services) (credit skold).
  > Scripted hook into 'LogOutput'?
* More flood protection (eg. nickname flood, X nicks in X seconds = kill?)
* Memo recall, ie, being able to delete unread memos you've sent to people.
x Nomemo nick option, and a nomemo exempt list (similar to ignore, but
  backwards, ignoring everyone and letting certain people thru)
* If a misconfigured server fights with services (ie a missing uline) have
  services go into a sort of standby mode, requiring any ircop to re enable
  them once the server has been fixed or removed (and leave certain commands
  like jupe active if the servers admin isnt around)
x Have memoserv understand ranges, ie read 2,3,4 ... del 1-5,8 .. etc
* Add a function to helpserv to forward messages to helpops
x Have load_database do only standard streaming loading of m2 dbases
    > have "loadolddbase" and "loadesperdbase" commands for services that need importing
      of old version databases.
* Secure Servers (Server cannot connect to network unless in services list of servers)
* Per-Channel clone limits/override lists (for kicking out)
