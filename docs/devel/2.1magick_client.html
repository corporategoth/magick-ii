            <h2><a name="1">Summary</a></h2>
            <p>
			Magick will be able to be completely interacted with, monitored and configured without having to
			log onto IRC or edit a configuration file, even remotely.  This will be done with two client
			interfaces to Magick.  The first will be a DCC and telnet interface (which will work the same
			way for both).  This interface will mostly allow viewing of data, and some special actions to
			be performed.  The more powerful interface will be the Magick client, which will allow full
			access to modifying the database, viewing the log file, and configuring Magick.
            </p><br />

            <h2><a name="2">Justification</a></h2>
            <p>
			User interfaces are one of the most important parts of any product.  Right now, Magick's existing
			configuration GUI is very limited (it will only generate and load a configuration file graphically),
			and does not really communicate with Magick at all.  Several services out there already have UI's
			that interact with services doing things like viewing log files, viewing/editing data, running
			reports, and triggering events (such as starting/stopping).  Magick loses ground against these
			kinds of services because of this.
            </p><br />

            <h2><a name="3">Pre-Requisites</a></h2>
            <p>
			The Inter-Magick Protocol must be created.
            </p><br />

            <h2><a name="4">Implementation</a></h2>
            <p>
			The Magick client will actually be two clients.  First the telnet and DCC interface that will
			allow certin control functions and extra viewing of data, etc than online MSG interfaces allow,
			however will still be restricted.  Second the Magick client which will implement the
			Inter-Magick Protocol, and be full featured allowing all kinds of log monitoring, file transfers,
			database updates, etc.
            </p><p>
			The telnet and DCC interface should first require authentication, being a registered nickname and
			password.  Depending on which committees the user is on (the telnet and DCC interface will only
			be available to those who are on privileged committees) will alter the commands that they will
			be able to execute.  These include anything from viewing data records, to performing various
			services functions they would be able to perform online anyway, to some specialized features
			such as log file or services activity monitoring.  Various periodic statistics will also be
			available in the telnet and DCC interface.  This concept is modelled of the eggdrop telner and
			DCC interface, and will have many similar concepts.
            </p><p>
			The Magick client will be a full GUI that will operate on both Windows and X-Windows, and will
			implement the Inter-Magick protocol.  This means that protocol-based authentication will be
			required, and encryption/compression will be supported.  The protocol-based authentication is
			much more secure than just a nickserv registered nickname and password.  The Magick client will
			have several screens, including:
			<ul>
			<li>	The server screen.  This will have multiple tabs, that either allow the user to perform
				operations on the server (eg. force a database save, config reload, etc), or show various
				statistics about the server (including those available with the STATS ServMsg command,
				and other stats not available otherwise).  This will also show information about the
				server we are currently connected to, such as its name, the protocol being spoken, the
				software version string, and statistics like amount of messages sent/received, etc.
			</li>
			<li>	The configuration screen.  This will display the current configuration of Magick (and
				feature an 'update' button to refresh the current config), and allow the user to modify
				the configuration, and send it back and get the Magick server to reload that configuration.
				This screen, like the current configuration GUI, will have various tabs.  It will also be
				able to generate a configuration file without being connected for use with initial creation.
			</li>
			<li>	The log tail screen.  This will display the current log file, and allow the user to scroll
				through and view it.  This display will keep growing, and the user will be able to always
				scroll to the bottom and see the most recent log output.
			</li>
			<li>	The data edit screen.  This, like the configuration screen will have many tabs of its own,
				representing each record type.  This will allow direct viewing and/or modification of the
				Magick database.  It will (obviously) have to perform all consistency checks (such as
				ensuring that if they change the founder of a channel, the nickname they choose is valid,
				etc).  There will be a preferences item to disable editing of values.
			</li>
			<li>	The reports screen.  This will allow a user to run queries on the database, showing, for
				example a display of all users who have the PRIVMSG setting on, or whatever.  This screen
				should allow the user to first select the type of records to do queries on, second the
				data values that should be in the query, and third the fields to shown in the results.
				The resulting report should allow all columns to be resized at will, and should allow
				hovering over a specific field to obtain the full text of the data within.
			</li>
			<li>	The magick interface screen.  This is equivalent to a telnet or DCC session, and will have
				an input box for the user to type commands, and will scroll the output that would be seen
				on a DCC or telnet session by.
			</li>
			</ul>
            </p><p>
			Connections will be established and disconnected by an option in a drop down menu.  The Magick
			client should maintain a server list (including passwords, encrypted) that a user will be able
			to select from, add to, and delete (and obviously connect to).  A preferences dialog should also
			be created for all configuration items of the Magick client itself, things like whether or not
			to enable editing of database values, etc.
            </p><br />

            <h2><a name="5">Potential Problems</a></h2>
            <p>
			This will be a VERY powerful tool, so all kinds of warnings should be added, to let the user
			know that if they dont restrict, for example, in the server where it will allow clients to
			connect from, or let their passwords get out, a network could be torn asunder with it.
