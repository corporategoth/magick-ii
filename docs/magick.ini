# All lines starting with the '#' (hash) are considered comments.
# All text after a ';' (semi-colon) character on a line is also
# considered a comment (unless preceeded by a '\' (backslash)
# character, when it is taken as literal).
# All values (ie. text after the = (equals) sign) is trimmed of
# spaces (and tabs) before and after it.  Using '\ ' (backslash
# space) will preserve spaces from the text to that point (ie.
# if before the text, from the '\ ' to the text, if after, from
# the end of the text to the '\ ').
# A '\' (backslash) at the end of a line will NOT continue to
# the next line, all relevant text must exist on ONE line.

# When specifying TIME values in this file, the following
# should be used:
#    s = seconds, m = minutes, h = hours,
#    d = days, w = weeks, y = years
#
# You specify a value as follows:
#    120s, 2m,  4h, 240m,  3w, 21d,  1y, 365d,  etc...
# You may also combine values, as follows:
#    4w3d6h5m20s,  2y40w5d, 4h3m53s, etc...
# Even out of order if you wish:
#    30s4m7h, 3m20d5h, 1y6m4d3h5w20s, etc...
#
# Please note, there is NO months indicator, as each month
# has a different number of days from one to the next.

# When specifying SIZE values in this file, the following
# should be used:
#    b = bytes, k = kilobytes, m = megabytes,
#    g = gigabytes, t = terrabytes
#
# You may specify a value as follows:
#    100b, 3k, 4m, 50g, 2t, etc...

# Server Allow.  If any of these are uncommented, then only
# servers listed with an ALLOW line will be allowed to
# connect to the network services are on.  This will stop
# unauthorised links, or differences in names allocated.
#
# These names are case sensative (deliberately, as many
# networks forbid the use of upper case server names).
# Remember, you must add an ALLOW before a server links to
# the network if you wish to use allows at all.
#
# Format is:  SERVER:UPLINK(S)
#
# The uplink field is seperated by commans (',') and allows
# wildcards (ie. '*' and '?').  If you leave it blank, then
# it will be allowed to link to anywhere, else it will only
# be allowed to link to servers that match one of the uplink
# listings.  You do not need to list services in the allow
# list, however you can (and should) list it in the uplink
# list if you are using uplink restrictions.
# If you use this feature, MAKE SURE you list all REMOTE
# entries, even if they are not the real server names.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE:  Remember all links are from services
# perspective, so if you are using 'uplinks', you should
# remember where services can be on the network (which might
# be totally different places if multipal REMOTE lines are
# used) -- if it is possible services could be linked on
# either side of a hub<->hub link, you should remember to put
# both hubs as uplinks of eachother (or * of course).
#
# Example of use:
# ALLOW_1         =hub1.us.magick.tm:
# ALLOW_2         =hub2.au.magick.tm:hub1.us.magick.tm, services.magick.tm
# ALLOW_3         =server1.us.magick.tm:*.us.magick.tm
# ALLOW_4         =server2.au.magick.tm:*.au.magick.tm
#
# hub1 may link anywhere (including us), hub2 may only uplink
# to hub1 (this does not count downlinks) or us (this will not
# effect hub1 when it links, because hub1 can uplink to anything).
# server1 may only link to another US server, server2 may only
# link to another AU server.  You could refine this more if you
# wanted to specify which hub each server links to, or have
# hub*.au.magick.tm or whatever in place.  Depends on your naming.

# Services Level is how Magick determines both which
# backup services to fail to, and who to give way to.
#
# When a new set of services comes online, the current
# mains will ALWAYS fail to it if it is a lower LEVEL.
# Services will be content to remain master while only
# other services of the same (or higher) level are online,
# unless it becomes too lagged or dies.  Minimum is 1.

# This is only the BASE LEVEL (ie. its minimum).  The
# actual failing level can be changed live depending on
# how lagged services are to their server (see below).
LEVEL           =1

# This determines how long a PING time from the network
# is unacceptable, and its time to relinquish MASTER
# or increase its 'failing' level temporarily.
# NOTE: The PING time is taken as an average excluding
#       the highest and lowest, as in:
# ((server pings)-(highest)-(lowest)) / ((# of servers)-2)
#
# If PING >= LAGTIME, increases level by 1, until it
# falls below it.  If PING >= LAGTIME*2 it increases
# level by 2 until it falls below, and so on.  When
# PING < LAGTIME, it will be back at its original level.
#
# When master, it will fail to one of the same level when
# PING >= LAGTIME.  It will fail to one of level+1 only
# when PING >= LAGTIME*2 (and if none of lower level is
# available), and so on.  It will take over master again
# from higher levels when it falls below the threshold
# that made it fail to them in the first place.

# Magick High Traffic Mode
# Four options are used to define limits, and initial values

# certain core features.  HTM may also be forced by SOP's.
# Automatic switching to HTM is worked out by calculating the
# bandwidth used over a set period of time, when HTM is
# activated, the gap the average is calculated over is slowly
# increased (by 2s each time) until the MAX is reached.  If
# we have not dropped below the bandwidth threshold by the time
# the MAX is reached, we will terminate the connection.
#
# The INIT_HTM_GAP is the initial time period that the HTM
# calculations are worked out over (and what it is set back to
# when HTM is turned off).  INIT_HTM_THRESH is the initial
# bandwidth threshold that Magick will ensure we are below before
# activating HTM -- This may be changed online.  The MAX_HTM_GAP
# is the time limit that if the 'gap' period (ie. how long a
# period we are going to work out HTM over) reaches it and is
# still above threshold, we will terminate the connection.
# HTM_ON_GAP is the amount of time HTM will remain active
# when it is FORCED on (unless HTM naturally takes over).
