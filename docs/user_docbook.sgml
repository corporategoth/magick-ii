<sect>Introduction<label id="Introduction">
<p>

Magick is a program that supplies IRC Services to an IRC Network.  They
connect to the network as if they were a server, and provide 'clients'
that users may interact with to achieve a variety of functions.

These functions include nickname registration, channel registration,
sending memos between users, and functions that allow IRC Operators to
maintain the control and direction of the IRC Network.

Magick is dedicated to the memory of PreZ's loving sister, Stacey Louise
Elder (1st Jan, 1975 - 25th Feb, 1998). She has been there for me more
than anyone over the years, and I was distraught when she died, may her
Lord love her as much as I did, and keep her safe like I could not.
Merry Parting, Dear Sister.

Magick is also dedicated to the memory of Ungod's brother, Edward Kevin
King (28th Aug, 1982 - 21st Nov, 1997), His life was short, but his memory
is great, never will those who knew him forget him.

<sect1>IRC in General<label id="Intro_IRC_in_General">
<p>

Internet Relay Chat (RFC1459) is a very simple protocol designed for user
to user communications.  There are many different types of clients,
servers and services out there for IRC.  Many different chat networks
exist, but the basic methods of joining channels, messaging users, etc is
the same on all of them.

Most IRC server software tends to be unmoderated -- this means that no
filtering is done by any human or mechanical means that will limit what
you can and cannot say.  This is both a blessing and a curse.  Legally
it means that nothing said or done on IRC is admissible in court, or
can be used as evidence.  However morally, it means that no protections
for children or easily offended people are enforced except voluntarily.

A very good site dedicated to help on the usage of IRC, how to get on it,
what networks exist, etc is available at http://www.irchelp.org.


<sect2>Wildcards<label id="Intro_Wildcards">
<p>
IRC in general uses two kinds of wildcards throughout its command and
general usage.  These are the * (asterisk) and ? (question mark).  The
* is used to denote 0 or more characters, the characters do not matter.
The ? is used to denote exactly 1 character, again the exact character
does not matter, as long as there's only 1.

So for example, the host castle.srealm.net.au would match all of these
wildcards:	
<verb>
		*.srealm.net.au
		*.srealm.???.au
		*.srealm.*.au
		??????.??????.???.??
</verb>

<sect2>Hostmasks<label id="Intro_Hostmasks">
<p>
A hostmask is used to depict 2 forms of user identifying information.
These are nickname!user@host or simply user@host, depending on the the
situation where it is used.  The correct format will usually be
specified.

Each hostmask has at least 2 parts, being the user and host.  These
may be seen when typing /whois nickname.  The user portion is also
known as an 'ident', and is supposed to be the login name the user
is using on the computer they are connecting from, but often it is
meaningless.  The host is the direct address of the computer that
the user is logged onto the Internet from.

Sometimes the nickname may be prepended to the user@host form of
hostmask by putting a '!' after the nickname, i.e., nickname!user@host.

All hostmasks may have wildcards to 'match' more than one variant on
a specific host.  This is mainly used in things such as your access
list, where you may put youruser@*.yourisp.com to match any dial-up
line coming from your own ISP.


<sect2>Time Formats<label id="Intro_Time_Formats">
<p>
The time formats used throughout this manual are specific to Magick. When
specifying a time, you must use a series of numbers and units, the
default unit being seconds.  The valid time units are:
	<tabular ca="l">
		s|second@
		m|minutes@
		h|hours@
		d|days@
		w|weeks@
		y|years@
	</tabular>

Any number immediately preceding a unit listed above will be considered
to by of that unit type.  i.e., 21s will be considered as 21 seconds, and
21m as 21 minutes.  You may string multiple time units together, i.e.,
3h15m means 3 hours and 15 minutes.

You may specify numbers higher than 'natural' unit boundaries (i.e., 100s
is valid), and you may specify units in any order.  Any numbers without
unit types following them will be assumed to be seconds.

Only positive time values are allowed, and it may not contain spaces.


<sect2>Space Formats<label id="Intro_Space_Formats">
<p>
As with time formats, all space formats are specific to Magick.
When specifying a space (or size), you must use a series of numbers
and units, the default unit being bytes.  The valid space units are:
	<tabular ca="l">
		b|bytes@
		k|kilobytes@
		m|megabytes@
		g|gigabytes@	
		t|terabytes@
	</tabular>

Any number immediately preceding a unit listed above will be considered
to by of that unit type.  i.e., 21b will be considered as 21 bytes, and
21k as 21 kilobytes.  You may string multiple time units together, i.e.,
3k80b means 3 kilobytes and 15 bytes.

You may specify numbers higher than 'natural' unit boundaries (i.e., 2000b
is valid), and you may specify units in any order.  Any numbers without
unit types following them will be assumed to be bytes.

Only positive space values are allowed, and it may not contain spaces.

<sect1>Documentation Key<label id="Intro_Documentation_Key">
<p>
<itemize>
Any parameter in <> braces are required.
Any parameter in [] braces are optional.
</itemize>
A pipe (|) in the parameter indicates that you may use any one of the
listed options, but only one.


<sect>NickServ<label id="NickServ">
<p>
NickServ is a service that allows you to register and maintain your
nickname.  It has functions that allow you to do anything from control
how and where your nickname may be used, to the purely informational.
Nicknames will expire after a period of non-use, talk to your IRC
operators to find out what this period is.

NickServ is usually the name used for this service, however it may
be called anything the network administrators of your network decide
to call it.  Common names are NickServ, NickS and NickOP.  All
commands to NickServ are done through private messages, or queries.
This document will assume you know how to send a private message.


<sect1>Nickname Ownership<label id="NickServ_Nickname_Ownership">
<p>
Owning a nickname means that you and only you can use it.  If someone
else tries to use your nickname, services will take action to prevent
it.  You may own more than one nickname, and even link them together
so all settings, channel/committee accesses and memos are linked.


<sect2>REGISTER<label id="NickServ_REGISTER">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: REGISTER <password> [email]
</verb>
This will register your nickname in services.  The password you specify
may be used by the IDENTIFY (<pageref id="NickServ_IDENTIFY">) command to enable extra functions
that require identification.  A default hostmask of *user@*.yourisp.com
will be added to your ACCESS (<pageref id="NickServ_ACCESS">) list.

The optional email will be set as your email address (<pageref id="NickServ_EMAIL">).  This is
an informational only field, however later may be used for things like
password retrieval, etc.  The password specified must be at least 5
characters long, and may not match your nickname.

Many functions are only available to registered nicknames.  Such as you
may not register a channel or be added to a channel's access list until
you are registered.


<sect2>DROP<label id="NickServ_DROP">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: DROP [nickname]
</verb>
This will unregister a nickname in services.  If no nickname is specified
then your current nickname is assumed.  You must be identified (<pageref id="NickServ_IDENTIFY">) to
use this command, and you may only specify a nickname that is linked to
your current nickname as a parameter.

Once the drop is completed, the nickname specified (or your nickname) may
be registered by anyone on the network, you relinquish all rights to it.
This action is final, so be sure you want to do this.


<sect2>LINK<label id="NickServ_LINK">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: LINK <nickname> <password>
</verb>
This will register your current nickname and link it to the nickname
specified.  The password specified must be the password of the nickname
you are linking to, AKA. the 'host' nickname.  Once linked the nicknames
become equivalent.  This means any access either your nick or the linked
nick has, both will have.  You will access the same memo list using either
nickname and you will not need to identify (<pageref id="NickServ_IDENTIFY">) again when changing
from one nickname to a linked nickname.

You may link any amount of nicknames.  Each linked nickname will expire
on its own time.  The host nickname will not expire until all its slave
nicknames are expired as well.  If your nickname is already registered
when you execute this command, all accesses you have will be transferred
to the host, and then your nickname will be linked.


<sect2>UNLINK<label id="NickServ_UNLINK">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: UNLINK [nickname]
</verb>
This will reverse the effects of the LINK (<pageref id="NickServ_LINK">) command.  This will
not drop your nickname, merely make a copy of all the settings the host
nickname has (including access list, etc) and then stop acknowledging
the host as equivalent.

If a nickname is specified, it will unlink that nickname rather than your
current nickname.  This nickname of course must be linked to your current
one (i.e., either a slave or sibling of your nick).  An unlinked nickname
will not be on any access lists, even if it was on them before the link.


<sect2>HOST<label id="NickServ_HOST">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: HOST [nickname]
</verb>
This will change your host nickname.  Each set of linked nicknames has
only 1 host.  If the host nickname is dropped, all slaves drop.  The
host nickname is also the keeper of all the settings and the memo list
for all linked nicknames.  It should be considered the primary nickname.
If a nickname is specified, it will be set as the host (as long as it is
linked to your current nickname).  Otherwise your current nickname will
be set as the host.


<sect2>IDENTIFY<label id="NickServ_IDENTIFY">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: IDENTIFY <password>
</verb>
This will identify you to your current nickname.  If you are coming from
a host not on your access list (<pageref id="NickServ_ACCESS">) and kill protection (<pageref id="NickServ_PROTECT">) is on
this is required else services will take action against you.  The password
specified is the password either set with the REGISTER (<pageref id="NickServ_REGISTER">) command or
changed with the PASSWORD (<pageref id="NickServ_PASSWORD">) setting.

If secure (<pageref id="NickServ_SECURE">) is on, you must identify even if your current hostmask
(<pageref id="Intro_Hostmasks">) is on your access list.  Identification enables many commands that
are not available if just recognized (i.e., your hostmask (<pageref id="Intro_Hostmasks">) matches
one on the access list, but your not identified).  The main ones are the
ability to change your password, or drop the nickname.


<sect2>ACCESS<label id="NickServ_ACCESS">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: ACCESS ADD <hostmask>
        ACCESS DEL <hostmask|number>
        ACCESS LIST
        ACCESS CURRENT
</verb>
This maintains your access list.  Your access list is simply a list of
hostmasks (<pageref id="Intro_Hostmasks">) that you will be recognized from without using the
IDENTIFY (<pageref id="NickServ_IDENTIFY">) command.  When on the access list, unless SECURE (<pageref id="NickServ_SECURE">)
is set on, you do not need to identify to do most commands.  Note that
channels and committees may also individually set SECURE (<pageref id="ChanServ_FOUNDER">3/<pageref id="CommServ_SECURE">)
on, in which case you will still need to identify to gain the relevant
privileges for that channel.

ADD will add a new host to your access list, using user@host hostmasks.
DEL will remove either a hostmask or the numbered entry from your
	access list.  The entry numbers are shown on a LIST.
LIST will list out all current entries on your access list.
CURRENT will add your current hostmask as *user@*.myisp.com to your
	access list.


<sect2>GHOST<label id="NickServ_GHOST">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: GHOST <nickname> <password>
</verb>
This will remove the nickname specified from the network.  The password
supplied must be the password for the nickname you wish to remove from
the network.  Only registered nicknames may be removed from the network.

This feature is designed to remove either clients that have not yet
timed out, but are no longer active, or services who are still holding
your nickname after kill protection (<pageref id="NickServ_PROTECT">) has activated.


<sect2>RECOVER<label id="NickServ_RECOVER">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: RECOVER <nickname> <password>
</verb>
This will cause services to take the nickname specified.  This is mainly
used when someone else keeps trying to use your nickname, and although
you can ghost them, they sign on before you can regain your nickname.
The password must be the correct password for the nickname supplied.


<sect1>Settings<label id="NickServ_Settings">
<p>

Each nickname has many settings.  These settings can do anything from
changing what authentication is required to use it, the language that
services should use, all the way up to purely informational settings.
All settings are changed using the SET prefix to the command names.


<sect2>PASSWORD<label id="NickServ_PASSWORD">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: SET PASSWORD <password>
</verb>
This will change your nickname password to whatever you set it to.  The
password specified must be at least 5 characters long, and may not match
your nickname.

Once the password is set, you will need to use it from that point on when
executing LINK (<pageref id="NickServ_LINK">), IDENTIFY (<pageref id="NickServ_IDENTIFY">), GHOST (<pageref id="NickServ_GHOST">) and RECOVER (<pageref id="NickServ_RECOVER">)
commands.

You must be identified to your nickname to use this command.


<sect2>EMAIL<label id="NickServ_EMAIL">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: SET EMAIL <email>
</verb>
This will set your email in services.  This is a purely informational
field, and will show up in your INFO (<pageref id="NickServ_INFO">) display.  The email address
itself will not be validated, but it must be an email address.

Although you can put a fake email address in, it is recommended you put
your real one in, as some networks use this address to email you a new
password when your old one is lost.

Setting this to NONE will clear this field.


<sect2>URL<label id="NickServ_URL">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: SET URL <url>
</verb>
This will set your web page address in services.  This is a purely
informational field, and will show up in your INFO (<pageref id="NickServ_INFO">) display.
You do not need to put the http:// in the address as it is supplied
for you if you left it out.

Setting this to NONE will clear this field.


<sect2>ICQ<label id="NickServ_ICQ">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: SET ICQ <uin>
</verb>
This will set your ICQ UIN in services.  This is a purely informational
field, and will show up in your INFO (<pageref id="NickServ_INFO">) display.  Right now nothing
is done with this information, but it is possible that a method may be
put into services that allow them to also show your status in your info.

Setting this to NONE will clear this field.


<sect2>AIM<label id="NickServ_AIM">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: SET AIM <screen name>
</verb>
This will set your AIM ID (AKA. screen name) in services.  This is a
purely informational field, and will show up in your INFO (<pageref id="NickServ_INFO">) display.
Right now nothing is done with this information, but it is possible that
a method may be put into services that allow them to also show your status
in your info.

Setting this to NONE will clear this field.


<sect2>MSN<label id="NickServ_MSN">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: SET MSN <passport email>
</verb>
This will set your MSN passport email sign-in name in services.  This is a
purely informational field, and will show up in your INFO (<pageref id="NickServ_INFO">) display.
Right now nothing is done with this information, but it is possible that
a method may be put into services that allow them to also show your status
in your info.

Setting this to NONE will clear this field.


<sect2>YAHOO<label id="NickServ_YAHOO">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: SET YAHOO <id>
</verb>
This will set your Yahoo! Messenger ID in services.  This is a purely
informational field, and will show up in your INFO (<pageref id="NickServ_INFO">) display.
Right now nothing is done with this information, but it is possible that
a method may be put into services that allow them to also show your status
in your info.

Setting this to NONE will clear this field.


<sect2>DESCRIPTION<label id="NickServ_DESCRIPTION">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: SET DESCRIPTION <description>
</verb>
This will set your description of yourself in services.  This is a
purely informational field, and will show up in your INFO (<pageref id="NickServ_INFO">) display.
I doubt anyone expects this to be accurate, so be as vain as you want.

Setting this to NONE will clear this field.


<sect2>PICTURE<label id="NickServ_PICTURE">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: SET PICTURE [NONE]
</verb>
This will set your picture in services.  Upon executing this command,
services will ask you to begin a DCC file transfer session with them to
send them a picture of yourself.  The file extensions allowed and image
size are limited, you may ask your IRC operators what these limits are.
These limits may include this feature being disabled all together.

Including the optional parameter of NONE will remove a picture if you
have one already stored in your nickname record.


<sect2>PROTECT<label id="NickServ_PROTECT">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: SET PROTECT <ON|OFF|RESET>
</verb>
This will turn on or off Kill Protection on your nickname.  With kill
protection set on your nickname, if you sign on from a host not on your
access list, your will be required to IDENTIFY (<pageref id="NickServ_IDENTIFY">) to your nickname.
If you fail to identify within a specific time period, you will be either
renamed to another nickname if the IRC server supports it, or killed.

If SECURE (<pageref id="NickServ_SECURE">) is also set on your nickname, then you will be required
to IDENTIFY (<pageref id="NickServ_IDENTIFY">) whether you are on your access list or not.

Setting this to RESET will set the value to whatever newly registered
	nicknames are set to (i.e., the default value).


<sect2>SECURE<label id="NickServ_SECURE">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: SET SECURE <ON|OFF|RESET>
</verb>
This will turn on or off Secure on your nickname.  With secure on, you
must IDENTIFY (<pageref id="NickServ_IDENTIFY">) to be able to do anything as your nickname.  This
option essentially renders your access list useless.

Setting this to RESET will set the value to whatever newly registered
	nicknames are set to (i.e., the default value).


<sect2>NOMEMO<label id="NickServ_NOMEMO">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: SET NOMEMO <ON|OFF|RESET>
</verb>
This will turn on or off No Memo on your nickname.  When no memo is off,
you will accept memos from all users except those on your IGNORE (<pageref id="NickServ_IGNORE">)
list.  When no memo is on, this behavior is reversed, and you will only
accepts memos from those on your IGNORE (<pageref id="NickServ_IGNORE">) list.

Setting this to RESET will set the value to whatever newly registered
	nicknames are set to (i.e., the default value).


<sect2>PRIVATE<label id="NickServ_PRIVATE">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: SET PRIVATE <ON|OFF|RESET>
</verb>
This will turn on or off Private on your nickname.  When private is on,
you will not show up in the LIST (<pageref id="NickServ_LIST">) of registered nicknames.  Also
the INFO (<pageref id="NickServ_INFO">) command will not show the hostmask (<pageref id="Intro_Hostmasks">) you were last
online from after you sign off.

Setting this to RESET will set the value to whatever newly registered
	nicknames are set to (ie. the default value).


<sect2>PRIVMSG<label id="NickServ_PRIVMSG">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: SET PRIVMSG <ON|OFF|RESET>
</verb>
This will turn on or off PRIVMSG on your nickname.  When PRIVMSG is on,
then services will communicate to you in a private messages (AKA. query)
window.  Otherwise services will communicate to you with NOTICE messages.

Setting this to RESET will set the value to whatever newly registered
	nicknames are set to (ie. the default value).


<sect2>LANGUAGE<label id="NickServ_LANGUAGE">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: SET LANGUAGE <language|RESET>
</verb>
This will change the language that services will talk to you in.  This
changes not just the text receive back from your commands, but the entire
HELP (<pageref id="NickServ_HELP">) output if it is available in your chosen language.

A list of available languages is available with the LANGUAGE (<pageref id="HelpServ_LANGUAGES">)
command.  Please note, that while most of the translations into other
languages are done by the Magick Translation Team <translators@magick.tm>,
some are done by third parties, so no guarantee of correctness is made.

Setting this to RESET will set the value to whatever newly registered
	nicknames are set to (ie. the default value).


<sect1>Other Commands<label id="NickServ_Other_Commands">
<p>

There are many other functions offered by NickServ that do not
specifically pertain to either owning a nickname or a setting of a
nickname.  Most of these are purely informational commands, however
some actually change the data stored in your nickname record.


<sect2>HELP<label id="NickServ_HELP">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: HELP [command]
</verb>
This will give you detailed help on the syntax of a command, and describe
what it does.  For subcommands, just separate the command and subcommand
with a space.


<sect2>LIST<label id="NickServ_LIST">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: LIST [nickmask [maximum]]
</verb>
This will list out all registered nicknames that match the nickmask
specified up to the maximum number of nicknames specified.  If neither is
specified, the default nickmask is *, and the default maximum is set
by the IRC network staff, so you may ask an IRC operators what it is.
There is also an absolute maximum above which you may not set your
maximum to, once again, you may ask your IRC operators what this is.

Any nickname set PRIVATE (<pageref id="NickServ_PASSWORD">1) will not show up in this list.


<sect2>INFO<label id="NickServ_INFO">
<p>

<verb>
SYNTAX: INFO <nickname>
</verb>

This will give you detailed information on a nickname entry.  This
information includes things such as when the nickname was registered,
if it is a slave, who its host is, the last time the user was online,
or what they are online as if they are online.  It will also give
you all the informational fields (email, url, description, etc) that
the user has set themselves.  Finally, it will tell you what committees
if any the user belongs to, and what settings the user has on their
nickname.


<sect2>SLAVES<label id="NickServ_SLAVES">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: SLAVES
</verb>
This will give you a list of all nicknames linked to your current host
nickname with the LINK (<pageref id="NickServ_LINK">) command.


<sect2>SEND<label id="NickServ_SEND">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: SEND <nickname>
</verb>
If a nickname has set a PICTURE (<pageref id="NickServ_PICTURE">) in services, this will allow you
to download that picture.  Once this command is executed, services will
initiate a DCC file transfer with you.  The file name is not the original
filename that the user uploaded, it is instead renamed to their nickname
with the appropriate file extension.


<sect2>IGNORE<label id="NickServ_IGNORE">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: IGNORE ADD <nickname>
        IGNORE DEL <nickname|number>
        IGNORE LIST
<verb>
This maintains your ignore list.  Your ignore list is a list of nicknames
that you will not accept memos from.  When the NOMEMO (<pageref id="NickServ_NOMEMO">) option is
set, the purpose of this list is reversed, and it becomes a list of
nicknames that you will accept memos from (meaning you will deny anyone
not on this list).

ADD will add a new nickname to your ignore list.
DEL will remove either a nickname or the numbered entry from your
	ignore list.  The entry numbers are shown on a LIST.
LIST will list out all current entries on your ignore list.


<sect1>IRC Operators<label id="NickServ_IRCOps">
<p>

IRC Operators, as you probably already know, have certain controls over
your nickname, up to and including killing you off the network.  However
some IRC Operators may also become Services Operators on your network.

Services operators have special access on services that allow them to do
a wide variety of things.  They can reset your password to a new password
for you, they can view your access list, and they may also suspend your
nickname if you do something against the network rules.


<p>
<sect>ChanServ<label id="ChanServ">
<p>

ChanServ is a service that allows you to register and maintain your
channels.  It has functions that allow you to do anything from control
who may enter your channel and who will be kicked out, to the purely
informational.  Channels will expire after a period of non-use, talk to
your IRC operators to find out what this period is.

NickServ is usually the name used for this service, however it may
be called anything the network administrators of your network decide
to call it.  Common names are ChanServ, ChanS and ChanOP.  All
commands to ChanServ are done through private messages, or queries.
This document will assume you know how to send a private message.


<sect1>Channel Ownership<label id="ChanServ_Channel_Ownership">
<p>

Owning a channel means that you may specify who can join and who cannot.
It means you can specify what access people who join the channel get, and
you can establish your own power hierarchy for your channel.  You may own
more than one channel, however there is a limit per user.


<sect2>REGISTER<label id="ChanServ_REGISTER">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: REGISTER <channel> <password> <description>
</verb>
This will register a channel in services.  The password you specify
may be used by the IDENTIFY (<pageref id="ChanServ_IDENTIFY">) command to enable extra functions
that require identification.  You will automatically be set as the
founder of the specified channel.  You must have a registered nickname
and be oped (mode +o) in the channel to register it.

The description specified is purely informational, and should be a brief
message saying what the channel is all about (for example it may just
be a "Chat Channel" or whatever).  The password specified must be at
least 5 characters long, and may not match your nickname or the channel
name.


<sect2>DROP<label id="ChanServ_DROP">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: DROP <channel>
</verb>
This will unregister a channel in services.  You must be identified
(<pageref id="ChanServ_IDENTIFY">) to the channel use this command.

Once the drop is completed, the channel specified may be registered by
anyone on the network, you relinquish all rights to it.  This action is
final, so be sure you want to do this.


<sect2>IDENTIFY<label id="ChanServ_IDENTIFY">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: IDENTIFY <channel> <password>
</verb>
This will make services recognize you as the founder of a channel.  As
founder you have access to do anything to a channel, including change the
password (<pageref id="ChanServ_PASSWORD">) or transfer ownership (<pageref id="ChanServ_FOUNDER">) .  Just being the founder
in the channel record is not enough to enable you to do these commands.

As founder, you also have complete control over the ACCESS (<pageref id="ChanServ_ACCESS">) list,
regardless of weather you are on it or not, or what level you have on it.


<sect2>ACCESS<label id="ChanServ_ACCESS">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: ACCESS <channel> ADD <nickname> <level>
        ACCESS <channel> DEL <nickname|number>
        ACCESS <channel> LIST
</verb>
This maintains a channels access list.   An access list is simply a list
of nicknames, and what access they have in the channel, which is a
number.  This number may be anything except 0 (which means 'not on the
access list at all'), and has upper and lower limits specified by the
IRC Operators.

Most ChanServ commands require a certain level of access to be used.
The actual levels required to execute each command is set with the LEVEL
(<pageref id="ChanServ_LEVEL">) command.  When the SECURE (<pageref id="ChanServ_FOUNDER">3) option is on, you will still
be required to IDENTIFY (<pageref id="NickServ_IDENTIFY">) to your nickname to have your access
rights acknowledged.

ADD will add a new nickname to the access list, it must be registered.
DEL will remove either a nickname or the numbered entry from the
	access list.  The entry numbers are shown on a LIST.
ADD and DEL require ACCESS privileges.
LIST will list out all current entries on the access list.  This command
	requires VIEW privileges.


<sect2>LEVEL<label id="ChanServ_LEVEL">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: LEVEL <channel> SET <type> <level>
        LEVEL <channel> RESET <type>
        LEVEL <channel> LIST
</verb>
This maintains a channels level list.  A level list is simply a list of
access types and what level is needed on the access list to execute a
command of that type.  This list and the ACCESS (<pageref id="ChanServ_ACCESS">) list are very
closely correlated, as any ChanServ checks first what level is required
to execute that command from this list, then if the user has that access.

The available level types you may set values for are:
AUTODEOP	Automatically remove voice (+v) and ops (+o) from user.
AUTOVOICE	Automatically give voice (+v) to user upon joining.
AUTOOP		Automatically give ops (+o) to user upon joining.
READMEMO	User is allowed to read channel news articles.
WRITEMEMO	User is allowed to post channel news articles.
DELMEMO		User is allowed to delete news articles not their own.
GREET		User may have an on-join greeting from ChanServ.
OVERGREET	User may set or lock greetings for other users.
MESSAGE		User may set an on-join message (seen by all who join).
AKICK		User may add and remove automatic kick entries.
SUPER		Mostly just enhanced privileges on other options.
UNBAN		User will automatically be unbanned if banned by server.
ACCESS		User may add and remove access list entries.
SET		User may use the SET command to modify channel settings.
VIEW		User may view things like channel modes, etc.
CMDINVITE	User may use the INVITE command.
CMDUNBAN	User may use the UNBAN command.
CMDVOICE	User may use the VOICE and DEVOICE command.
CMDOP		User may use the OP and DEOP command.
CMDKICK		User may use the KICK command.
CMDMODE		User may use the MODE command to set modes.
CMDCLEAR	User may use the CLEAR command.

If any type is set to 0, then any users joining channel may access it
without being on the access list, unless they are on the access list
at a level below 0.  All of the above levels are checked as 'If the user
is on the access list at or above this level, allow this privilege'
except the AUTODEOP level, which is checked as 'If the user is on the
access list at or below this level, this condition applies'.

SET will set the type specified to the level specified.
RESET will reset the type specified to the default value that all newly
	registered channels are set to (ie. the default value).
SET and RESET require you to IDENTIFY (<pageref id="ChanServ_IDENTIFY">) as founder.
If you have SET privileges or above, LIST will list out all levels and
what they are currently set to.  Otherwise LIST will list out all levels
you have access to.


<sect2>AKICK<label id="ChanServ_AKICK">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: AKICK <channel> ADD <nickname|hostmask> [reason]
        AKICK <channel> DEL <nickname|hostmask|number>
        AKICK <channel> LIST
</verb>
This maintains a channels auto kick list.   An auto kick list is simply
a list of nicknames or hostmasks that are not allowed to enter the
channel, and the reason for which they have been exiled.

ADD will add a new registered nickname or hostmask to the auto kick list.
DEL will remove either a nickname, hostmask or the numbered entry from
	the auto kick list.  The entry numbers are shown on a LIST.
ADD and DEL require AKICK privileges.
LIST will list out all current entries on the auto kick list.  This
	command requires VIEW privileges.


<sect1>Settings<label id="ChanServ_Settings">
<p>

Each channel has many settings.  These settings can do anything from
changing how vindictive services will act, the op / DEOP behavior,
channel timings, all the way up to purely informational settings.
All settings are changed using the SET prefix to the command names.


<sect2>FOUNDER<label id="ChanServ_FOUNDER">
<p>

SYNTAX: SET <channel> FOUNDER <nickname>

This will transfer ownership of the channel to another user.  On many
networks, whoever is listed as the owner, is the final authority of any
channel, regardless of how many people have the password.  No other
changes are made except who services see as the founder.  The nickname
specified must be a registered nickname.  If the nickname is already
the COFOUNDER (<pageref id="ChanServ_COFOUNDER">), then the co-founder field will be cleared.

You must IDENTIFY (<pageref id="ChanServ_IDENTIFY">) as founder to use this command.


<sect2>COFOUNDER<label id="ChanServ_COFOUNDER">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: SET <channel> COFOUNDER <nickname>
</verb>
This will set the co-founder field to the nickname specified.  This
nickname must be registered.  You may not specify the same nickname
as the current FOUNDER (<pageref id="ChanServ_FOUNDER">).

This field offers no actual additional access to the channel, so even if
a user is listed as the co-founder, they must still be on the ACCESS
(<pageref id="ChanServ_ACCESS">) list to gain any actual access in channel.  However if the
current founders nickname should expire, the channel will automatically
be transferred to the co-founder.  If there is no co-founder specified,
then the channel will be removed along with the nicknames expiry.

Setting this to NONE will clear this field.
You must IDENTIFY (<pageref id="ChanServ_IDENTIFY">) as founder to use this command.


<sect2>PASSWORD<label id="ChanServ_PASSWORD">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: SET <channel> PASSWORD <password>
</verb>
This will change the channel password to whatever you set it to.  The
password specified must be at least 5 characters long, and may not match
your nickname or the channel name.

Once the password is set, you will need to use it from that point on when
executing IDENTIFY (<pageref id="ChanServ_IDENTIFY">) command.

You must IDENTIFY (<pageref id="ChanServ_IDENTIFY">) as founder to use this command.


<sect2>DESCRIPTION<label id="ChanServ_DESCRIPTION">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: SET <channel> DESCRIPTION <description>

<sect2>EMAIL<label id="ChanServ_EMAIL">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: SET <channel> EMAIL <email>
</verb>
This will set the channel's email in services.  This is a purely
informational field, and will show up in the INFO (<pageref id="ChanServ_INFO">) display.
The email address itself will not be validated, but it must be an email
address.

Although you can put a fake email address in, it is recommended you put
a real one in, as some networks use this address to email a new password
when the old one is lost.

Setting this to NONE will clear this field.
You must have SET privileges to use this command.


<sect2>URL<label id="ChanServ_URL">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: SET <channel> URL <url>
</verb>
This will set the channel's web page address in services.  This is a
purely informational field, and will show up in the INFO (<pageref id="ChanServ_INFO">)
display.  You do not need to put the http:// in the address as it is
supplied for you if you left it out.

Setting this to NONE will clear this field.
You must have SET privileges to use this command.


<sect2>MLOCK<label id="ChanServ_MLOCK">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: SET <channel> MLOCK <modes> [arguments]
</verb>
This will set the channel's mode lock in services.  All modes in the
mode lock will be enforced at all times.  You may force modes on or off
by using the + or - sign.  You may include +l and +k in the mode lock,
and their values will be read in the order they're used.  You may not
specify any other mode that accepts arguments (e.g., +o).  No other
checking is done on the modes specified, if the IRC server supports it,
it will be set and enforced.

Setting this to NONE will clear this field.

SYNTAX: SET <channel> BANTIME <time|RESET>
</verb>
This will set the value of Ban Time on the channel.  When the ban time
is set to a non-zero amount, then any ban set in channel will expire and
automatically be removed after the time specified has elapsed.  The time
should be specified in Magick's own Time Format (<pageref id="Intro_Time_Formats">).  Note that even
bans set by AKICK (<pageref id="ChanServ_AKICK">) will expire, but be reset the next time the
user who triggered AKICK joins again.

Setting this to RESET will set the value to whatever newly registered
	channels are set to (ie. the default value).
You must have SET privileges to use this command.


<sect2>PARTTIME<label id="ChanServ_PARTTIME">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: SET <channel> PARTTIME <time|RESET>
</verb>

(<pageref id="ChanServ_REVENGE">).

Setting this to RESET will set the value to whatever newly registered
	channels are set to (ie. the default value).

This will set the value of Revenge on the channel.  When the revenge type
is not NONE, then any time a DEOP, kick or ban is performed against
someone who is higher on the access list, the action is reversed.  When
the revenge type is anything but REVERSE, the specified action is taken
against the user who triggered revenge.

The available revenge types you may set are:
NONE		Disable revenge totally.

function has no real purpose except aesthetics (some people like it).

Setting this to RESET will set the value to whatever newly registered
	channels are set to (ie. the default value).
You must have SET privileges to use this command.


<sect1>Other Commands<label id="ChanServ_Other_Commands">
<p>

There are many other functions offered by ChanServ that do not
specifically pertain to either owning a channel or a setting of a
channel.  Most of these are either purely informational commands, or
commands that affect the 'current' channel (as opposed to the stored
record), however some do actually change the data stored.


<sect2>HELP<label id="ChanServ_HELP">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: HELP [command]
</verb>
This will give you detailed help on the syntax of a command, and describe
what it does.  For subcommands, just separate the command and subcommand

<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: LIST [channel-mask [maximum]]
</verb>
This will list out all registered channels that match the channelmask
specified up to the maximum number of channels specified.  If neither is
specified, the default channel is *, and the default maximum is set by 
the IRC network staff, so you may ask an IRC operators what it is.  There
is also an absolute maximum above which you may not set your maximum to,
once again, you may ask your IRC operators what this is.

This will give you detailed information on a channel entry.  This
information includes things such as when the channel was registered,
who owns it, who is in it, the last time it was used, channel topic,
revenge level, ban removal and greet times.  It will also give you
all the informational fields (email, url, description, etc) that have

<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: INVITE <channel> [nickname]
</verb>
This will invite the given nickname to the channel if it is supplied, or

        CLEAR <channel> VOICES
        CLEAR <channel> USERS
        CLEAR <channel> ALL
</verb>
This command is used to do things 'en mass'.  The clear command should
not be used lightly, but it is sometimes useful to do these kinds of
actions on a large scale.

MODES will remove all modes excluding +b (bans), +o (ops) and +v (voices).
BANS will remove all bans (+b) from channel.
OPS will remove all ops (+o) from channel.
VOICES will remove all voices (+v) from channel.

        GREET <channel> LIST [[@]nickname|ALL]
</verb>
This maintains a channels greeting list.   A greeting list is simply a
list of nicknames, and what ChanServ should say when they join.  This
is purely a vanity feature.

ADD will add a new greeting to the greeting list.  If a nickname is
	specified (by putting an @ in front of it), it will be set
	for that user, otherwise it will be set for your own nickname.
	If the first character of a greeting is '!', it denotes the
	greeting is locked, and only someone with OVERGREET may remove
	it.  You must have GREET privileges to set a a greeting for
	yourself, and OVERGREET to set it for another user, or lock
	a greeting.
DEL will remove a greeting from the greeting list.  If a nickname is

	user, otherwise your own greeting will be removed.  You must
	have GREET privileges to remove your own greeting, or OVERGREET
	to remove another user's.
LIST will display a greeting from the greeting list.  If a nickname is
	specified (the @ is optional), it will display that user's
	greeting, otherwise it will display your own.  If ALL is
	specified, all greetings currently active are displayed.
	You must have GREET privileges to see your own greeting, or
	OVERGREET to see another user's, or ALL.


<sect2>MESSAGE<label id="ChanServ_MESSAGE">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: MESSAGE <channel> ADD <message>
        MESSAGE <channel> DEL <number>
        MESSAGE <channel> LIST
</verb>
This maintains a channels on-join message list.   An on-join message list
is simply a list of messages that will be sent to users when they join
the channel.  This usually contains things like brief overviews of the
channel rules, etc.

ADD will add a new message to the on-join message list.
DEL will remove the numbered entry from the on-join message list.  The
	entry numbers are shown on a LIST.
LIST will list out all current entries on the on-join message list.

You must have MESSAGE privileges to use this command.


<sect1>IRC Operators<label id="ChanServ_IRCOps">
<p>

IRC Operators, as you probably already know, have certain controls over
a channel.  Some IRC Operators may also become Services Operators on your
network.

Services operators have special access on services that allow them to do
a wide variety of things.  They can reset the channel password to a new
password for you, they can view the access list, AKICK list, greetings
list, on-join messages list, they can use the INVITE, UNBAN, OP, DEOP,
VOICE and DEVOICE commands, and they may also suspend the channel if
something is done against the network rules.


<sect>MemoServ<label id="MemoServ">
<p>

MemoServ is a service that allows you to leave a message for another
user to retrieve at a later time (presumably because they are idle
or offline).  It also allows you to post news articles for a channel.
News articles are identical to user memos except that they expire.

MemoServ is usually the name used for this service, however it may
be called anything the network administrators of your network decide
to call it.  Common names are MemoServ, MemoS and MemoOP.  All
commands to MemoServ are done through private messages, or queries.
This document will assume you know how to send a private message.


<sect1>Normal Usage
<p>

The command set for MemoServ is relatively small, so all commands that
available for MemoServ have been condensed into one section.  MemoServ
stores a memo list for every nickname that is not a slave, and a news
list for every channel.


<sect2>HELP<label id="MemoServ_HELP">
<p>

SYNTAX: HELP [command]

This will give you detailed help on the syntax of a command, and describe
what it does.  For subcommands, just separate the command and subcommand
with a space.

<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: LIST [channel]
</verb>
This will list all news articles for the specified channel, or all memos
you have in your personal memo list if no channel is specified.  The time
the memo or news article was sent, who sent it, and the first 20
characters of the message will be displayed.  All memos or news articles
that you have not yet read, or have been marked UNREAD (<pageref id="MemoServ_UNREAD">) will have
a * before the entry number.

You must have READMEMO privileges if a channel is specified.


<sect2>READ<label id="MemoServ_READ">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: READ [channel] <numbers|ALL|UNREAD>
</verb>
This will display the full text of one or more memos or news articles,
marking them as read in the process.  Numbers may be specified as a
series (e.g., 1,3,5) or range (e.g., 1-5) or any combination of these as
long as there are no spaced involved.  If ALL is specified, all memos or
news articles will be displayed, if UNREAD is specified, all memos or
news articles which you have not yet read, or have been marked as UNREAD
(<pageref id="MemoServ_UNREAD">) will be displayed.

You must have READMEMO privileges if a channel is specified.


<sect2>UNREAD<label id="MemoServ_UNREAD">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: UNREAD [channel] <numbers|ALL>
</verb>
This will mark one or more memos or news articles as unread.  This will
force services to notify you of an unread memo upon sign-on, or news
article when you join the channel.  Numbers may be specified as a
series (e.g., 1,3,5) or range (e.g., 1-5) or any combination of these as
long as there are no spaced involved.  If ALL is specified, all memos or
news articles will be marked unread.

You must have READMEMO privileges if a channel is specified.


<sect2>SEND<label id="MemoServ_SEND">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: SEND <nickname|channel> <message>
</verb>
This will send a memo or news article to another nickname or channel
respectively.  Once you initiate the send, you will have up to a certain
time limit defined by the network administrators to either CONTINUE
(<pageref id="MemoServ_CONTINUE">) the message, or CANCEL (<pageref id="MemoServ_CANCEL">) it.  After that time expires,
it will automatically be sent to the recipient.

If a memo or news article is pending when this command is executed,
it will automatically be sent.

You must have WRITEMEMO privileges if a channel is specified.


<sect2>CONTINUE<label id="MemoServ_CONTINUE">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: CONTINUE <message>
</verb>
This will continue a pending memo or news article.  Usually this is
needed when the message you are sending was truncated in the initial
SEND (<pageref id="MemoServ_SEND">), and you had not finished what you had to say.  The
theoretical maximum size of a memo or news article is unlimited.
This command will also reset the time you have to either continue
the message even more, or CANCEL (<pageref id="MemoServ_CANCEL">) it.


<sect2>PREVIEW<label id="MemoServ_PREVIEW">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: PREVIEW
</verb>
This will display back what the currently pending memo or news article
says.  In essence, it offers you a chance to proof read what you have
written before sending it.  This will NOT affect the time remaining
before a FLUSH (<pageref id="MemoServ_FLUSH">) is automatically done and the message is sent.


<sect2>FLUSH<label id="MemoServ_FLUSH">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: FLUSH
</verb>
This will send the pending memo or news article immediately, without
waiting for the time since the last SEND (<pageref id="MemoServ_SEND">) or CONTINUE (<pageref id="MemoServ_CONTINUE">)
to expire.


<sect2>CANCEL<label id="MemoServ_CANCEL">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: CANCEL
</verb>
This will abort a pending memo or news article.  It will never be sent.
Once the memo or news article has been sent, it cannot be canceled.


<sect2>REPLY<label id="MemoServ_REPLY">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: REPLY [channel] <number> <message>
</verb>
This will send a memo back to the originator of the memo or news article
you specify by number.  You may only specify one number.  The first 20
characters of the original message along with an indication that the
message is a reply (and where it was from if it is a news article) are
automatically prefixed to the specified message.

You must have READMEMO privileges if a channel is specified.


<sect2>FORWARD<label id="MemoServ_FORWARD">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: FORWARD [channel] <number> <nickname|channel>
</verb>
This will forward the memo or news article you specify by number directly
to another nickname or channel.  You may only specify one number.  The
originator of the memo or news article, along with the channel it is from
for news articles will be automatically prefixed to the original message,
along with an indication that it is a forwarded message.

If you are forwarding from a channel, you must have READMEMO privileges.
If you are forwarding to a channel, you must have WRITEMEMO privileges.


<sect2>DEL<label id="MemoServ_DEL">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: DEL [channel] <numbers|ALL|READ>
</verb>
This will delete one or more memos or news articles.  This action is
permanent, and cannot be reversed.  Numbers may be specified as a
series (e.g., 1,3,5) or range (e.g., 1-5) or any combination of these as
long as there are no spaced involved.  If ALL is specified, all memos or
news articles will deleted, if READ is specified, only those which you
have READ (<pageref id="MemoServ_READ">) will be removed.

You must have WRITEMEMO privileges to delete any news article you have
posted yourself, or DELMEMO privileges to delete someone else's.


<sect2>FILE<label id="MemoServ_FILE">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: FILE <nickname> [message]
</verb>
This command acts the same as the SEND (<pageref id="MemoServ_SEND">) command, except that you
must initiate a DCC file transfer to services before the time limit
expires.  As with SEND, you may use the CONTINUE (<pageref id="MemoServ_CONTINUE">) command to
extend the time limit, and CANCEL (<pageref id="MemoServ_CANCEL">) to abort the memo.  Once the
file transfer has started, the time limit is removed, and the memo is
sent as soon as the file transfer completes.  You may not specify a
channel as the recipient, as only memos may have file attachments.


<sect2>GET<label id="MemoServ_GET">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: GET <numbers>
</verb>
This will send the file attachments for one or more memos.  Numbers
may be specified as a series (e.g., 1,3,5) or range (e.g., 1-5) or any
combination of these as long as there are no spaced involved.  For each
memo specified that has a file attachment, services will initiate a DCC
file transfer to you with the file attachment.


<sect1>Settings<label id="MemoServ_Settings">
<p>

MemoServ settings only really make sense on news articles, and even
then there is only a small amount of settings that are reasonable.
All settings are changed using the SET prefix to the command names.


<sect2>NOEXPIRE<label id="MemoServ_NOEXPIRE">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: SET <channel> NOEXPIRE <ON|OFF|RESET> <numbers|ALL>
</verb>
This will turn on or off No Expire on the news articles(s) specified.
When no expire is on, a news article will never expire, it must be
deleted (<pageref id="MemoServ_DEL">) explicitly.  Numbers may be specified as a series
(e.g., 1,3,5) or range (e.g., 1-5) or any combination of these as long as
there are no spaced involved.  If ALL is specified, all news articles
will have no expire set on or off.

Setting this to RESET will set the value to whatever new news articles
	are set to (ie. the default value).
You must have DELMEMO privileges to use this command.


<sect1>IRC Operators
<p>

IRC Operators, as you probably already know, have certain controls over
the network.  Some IRC Operators may also become Services Operators on
your network.

Services operators have no special powers over memos or news articles.



<sect>CommServ<label id="CommServ">
<p>

CommServ is a service that allows you to create groups of users for
various purposes - mainly contact-ability purposes.  Committees control
everything from what commands you may use in services, to what messages
you see when you sign online.

CommServ is usually the name used for this service, however it may
be called anything the network administrators of your network decide
to call it.  Since CommServ is unique to Magick, there are no other
commonly known names for CommServ.  All commands to CommServ are done
through private messages, or queries.  This document will assume you
know how to send a private message.


<sect1>Normal Usage<label id="CommServ_Normal_Usage">
<p>

The command set for CommServ is relatively small, so all commands that
available for CommServ have been condensed into one section.  Apart from
committees created by the network administrators, there are 6 default
committees - commonly known as ALL, REGD, OPER, ADMIN, SOP and SADMIN.
ALL represents all users currently online, REGD represents all registered
users - they have no MEMBER (<pageref id="CommServ_MEMBER">) list to be maintained.  All members
of SADMIN are considered the head of the SOP and ADMIN committees, and
all members of the ADMIN committee are considered the head of the OPER
committee.  The settings for these 6 committees may not be changed.


<sect2>HELP<label id="CommServ_HELP">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: HELP [command]
</verb>
This will give you detailed help on the syntax of a command, and describe
what it does.  For subcommands, just separate the command and subcommand
with a space.


<sect2>LIST<label id="CommServ_LIST">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: LIST [committeemask [maximum]]
</verb>
This will list out all committees that match the committeemask specified
up to the maximum number of committees specified.  If neither is
specified, the default committeemask is *, and the default maximum is set
by the IRC network staff, so you may ask an IRC operators what it is.
There is also an absolute maximum above which you may not set your
maximum to, once again, you may ask your IRC operators what this is.

Any committee set PRIVATE (<pageref id="CommServ_PRIVATE">) will not show up in this list.


<sect2>INFO<label id="CommServ_INFO">
<p>

SYNTAX: INFO <committee>

This will give you detailed information on a committee entry.  This
information includes things such as when the committee was registered,
who is in charge, and how many members it has.  It will also give
you all the informational fields (email, url, description, etc) that
the committee head has set themselves.  Finally, it will tell you what
settings the committee has on set.


<sect2>MEMO<label id="CommServ_MEMO">

<verb>
SYNTAX: MEMO <message>
</verb>
This will send a memo to all committee members.  This works as if you
had used a MemoServ SEND (<pageref id="MemoServ_SEND">) to all members of the committee.  If
OPENMEMOS (<pageref id="CommServ_OPENMEMOS">) is on, then any member of the committee may use this,
otherwise only the committee head(s) may use this feature.  There is
no memo timeout for committee based memos, they are flushed immediately.


<sect2>MEMBER<label id="CommServ_MEMBER">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: MEMBER <committee> ADD <nickname>
        MEMBER <committee> DEL <nickname|number>
        MEMBER <committee> LIST
</verb>
This maintains the member list.  The member list is simply a list of
nicknames that are on the committee.  When on the member list, unless
SECURE (<pageref id="CommServ_SECURE">) is set on, you do not need to IDENTIFY (<pageref id="NickServ_IDENTIFY">) to do most
commands.

ADD will add a new nickname to the member list.
DEL will remove either a nickname or the numbered entry from the
	member list.  The entry numbers are shown on a LIST.
LIST will list out all current entries on the member list.  Anyone may
	use this command unless PRIVATE (<pageref id="CommServ_PRIVATE">) is set on.


<sect2>LOGON<label id="CommServ_LOGON">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: LOGON <committee> ADD <message>
        LOGON <committee> DEL <number>
        LOGON <committee> LIST
</verb>
This maintains the signon message list.  The signon message list is
simply a list of messages that will be sent to a user when they are
recognized as being on the committee (usually signing online).  These
messages will also be sent if the user comes back from being away.

ADD will add a new message to the signon message list.
DEL will remove the numbered entry from the signon message list.
	The entry numbers are shown on a LIST.
LIST will list out all current entries on the signon message list.


<sect1>Settings<label id="CommServ_Settings">
<p>

Each committee has many settings.  These settings can do anything from
transferring ownership of the committee, change who can do various
commands,  all the way up to purely informational settings.
All settings are changed using the SET prefix to the command names.


<sect2>HEAD<label id="CommServ_HEAD">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: SET <committee> HEAD <nickname>
</verb>
This will transfer ownership of the committee to another user.  On many
networks, whoever is listed as the owner, is the final authority of any

	committees are set to (ie. the default value).


<sect2>PRIVATE<label id="CommServ_PRIVATE">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: SET <committee> PRIVATE <ON|OFF|RESET>

<sect1>IRC Operators<label id="CommServ_IRCOps">
<p>

IRC Operators, as you probably already know, have certain controls over
a committee.  Some IRC Operators may also become Services Operators on
your network.

Services operators have special access on services that allow them to do
a wide variety of things.  They can view the member list (even when
PRIVATE is on), and the list of signon messages.  They may also create
new committees or remove defunct ones.


<p>
<sect>HelpServ<label id="HelpServ">
<p>

HelpServ is a service that fulfills an entirely informational purpose.
This service is also the global noticer (the service used for sending
out messages to all users when necessary).

HelpServ is usually the name used for this service, however it may
be called anything the network administrators of your network decide
to call it.  Common names are ChanServ, ChanS and ChanOP.  All
commands to ChanServ are done through private messages, or queries.
This document will assume you know how to send a private message.


<sect1>Normal Usage<label id="HelpServ_Normal_Usage">
<p>

The command set for HelpServ is relatively small, so all commands that
available for HelpServ have been condensed into one section.  All
commands except those that deal with the public file system are purely
informational.


<sect2>HELP<label id="HelpServ_HELP">

of them have to services, and how much (percentage wise) of the network
they hold.


<sect2>STATS<label id="HelpServ_STATS">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: STATS
</verb>
This will give you brief statistics about services, including how long

since services have been up) and how many clones are online.


<sect2>LANGUAGES<label id="HelpServ_LANGUAGES">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: LANGUAGES
</verb>
This will tell you what languages are available as settings for the
LANGUAGE (<pageref id="NickServ_PASSWORD">3) nickname setting.  If you set your language to one
of these languages, services will reply to all commands in that language.
If there is help available in that language, it will also be used.


<sect2>FILE<label id="HelpServ_FILE">
<p>
<verb>
SYNTAX: FILE SEND <filename>
        FILE LIST [filemask [maximum]]
</verb>
This is an interface into the public file system.  Services Operators may
upload files that are available for users to download at will.  You may
not upload files into the public file system.

SEND will cause services to initiate a DCC file transfer to you with the
	file name specified.
LIST will display a listing of all available file names that match the
	filemask specified up to the maximum number of files specified.
	If neither is specified, the default filemask is *, and the
	default maximum is set by the IRC network staff, so you may ask

<sect1>IRC Operators<label id="HelpServ_IRCOps">
<p>

IRC Operators, as you probably already know, have certain controls over
the network.  Some IRC Operators may also become Services Operators on
your network.

The only thing services operators can really do with HelpServ is send a
