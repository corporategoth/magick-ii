Build instructions for MAGICK and associated utilities.
=======================================================

MAGICK (Part 1)
------

~$ tar xvfz Magick-x.x.tar.gz

ACE
---

Download ACE from http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-obtain.html
It is recommended you use the 'current beta' copy.  If you cannot compile
this, PLEASE do not email the Magick development team, email the people
who WROTE it.

~$ tar xvfz ACE.tar.gz
~$ cd ACE_wrappers
~/ACE_wrappers$ export ACE_ROOT=`pwd`
~/ACE_wrappers$ cd ace
~/ACE_wrappers/ace$ ls config*

Find the config-*.h file that best suits YOUR platform.

~/ACE_wrappers/ace$ ln -s config-system.h config.h
~/ACE_wrappers/ace$ cd ../include/makeinclude
~/ACE_wrappers/include/makeinclude$ ls platform*

Find the platform_*.GNU file that best suits YOUR platform.

~/ACE_wrappers/include/makeinclude$ ln -s platform_system.GNU platform_macros.GNU
~/ACE_wrappers/include/makeinclude$ cd ../..
~/ACE_wrappers$ make

When this is done, copy ace/*.so to some place that your compiler will
pick it up (on SunOS, a directory in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH, for other
platforms it could be a directory in /etc/ld.so.conf), and run ldconfig.
Usually /usr/local/lib is a good place for the *.so files.

Then, if you have root and copied the *.so files to /usr/local/lib, then
copy ace/*.cpp, ace/*.h and ace/*.i to /usr/local/include/ace (make the
directory if nessicary).  If you do NOT have root, copy the above files
to your Magick-x.x/include/ace directory (create it if nessicary).

~/ACE_wrappers$ cd ..

ZLIB
----

IF you have libz on your system (/usr/lib/libz*), you can skip this section.
If you have libgz on your system (/usr/lib/libgz*), then edit your Magick
Makefile.inc, and change -lz to -lgz, and skip the rest of this section.

You can download zlib from http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib

~$ tar xvfz zlib-1.1.3

Edit your Magick Makefile.inc and remove '-lz' from the LFLAGS veriable.
Edit your Magick Makefile, and uncomment the ZDIR and LIBZ environment veriables,
and put '../zlib-1.1.3' as the paramater for ZDIR (or the actual location of
where you uncompressed ZLIB if it is different).


MAGICK (Part 2)
------

~$ cd Magick-x.x

Edit your Magick Makefile and set the TOPDIR to your current directory.

~/Magick-x.x$ make

That should be it, you can run it from the current directory.
