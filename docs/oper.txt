==========================================================================
  Section 1 - Introduction
==========================================================================

Magick is a program that supplies IRC Services to an IRC Network.  They
connect to the network as if they were a server, and provide 'clients'
that users may interact with to achieve a variety of functions.

These functions include nickname registration, channel registration,
sending memos between users, and functions that allow IRC Operators to
maintain the control and direction of the IRC Network.

Magick is dedicated to the memory of PreZ's loving sister, Stacey Louise
Elder (1st Jan, 1975 - 25th Feb, 1998). She has been there for me more
than anyone over the years, and I was distraught when she died, may her
Lord love her as much as I did, and keep her safe like I could not.
Merry Parting, Dear Sister.

Magick is also dedicated to the memory of Ungod's brother, Edward Kevin
King (28th Aug, 1982 - 21st Nov, 1997), His life was short, but his memory
is great, never will those who knew him forget him.

1.4	IRC in General
======================

Internet Relay Chat (RFC1459) is a very simple protocol designed for user
to user communications.  There are many different types of clients,
servers and services out there for IRC.  Many different chat networks
exist, but the basic methods of joining channels, messaging users, etc is
the same on all of them.

Most IRC server software tends to be unmoderated -- this means that no
filtering is done by any human or mechanical means that will limit what
you can and cannot say.  This is both a blessing and a curse.  Legally
it means that nothing said or done on IRC is admissible in court, or
can be used as evidence.  However morally, it means that no protections
for children or easily offended people are enforced except voluntarily.

A very good site dedicated to help on the usage of IRC, how to get on it,
what networks exist, etc is available at http://www.irchelp.org.


1.4.1	Wildcards
-----------------

IRC in general uses two kinds of wildcards throughout its command and
general usage.  These are the * (asterisk) and ? (question mark).  The
* is used to denote 0 or more characters, the characters do not matter.
The ? is used to denote exactly 1 character, again the exact character
does not matter, as long as there's only 1.

So for example, the host castle.srealm.net.au would match all of these
wildcards:	*.srealm.net.au
		*.srealm.???.au
		*.srealm.*.au
		??????.??????.???.??


1.4.2	Hostmasks
-----------------

A hostmask is used to depict 2 forms of user identifying information.
These are nickname!user@host or simply user@host, depending on the the
situation where it is used.  The correct format will usually be
specified.

Each hostmask has at least 2 parts, being the user and host.  These
may be seen when typing /whois nickname.  The user portion is also
known as an 'ident', and is supposed to be the login name the user
is using on the computer they are connecting from, but often it is
meaningless.  The host is the direct address of the computer that
the user is logged onto the internet from.

Sometimes the nickname may be prepended to the user@host form of
hostmask by putting a '!' after the nickname, ie. nickname!user@host.

All hostmasks may have wildcards to 'match' more than one variant on
a specific host.  This is mainly used in things such as your access
list, where you may put youruser@*.yourisp.com to match any dialup
line coming from your own ISP.


1.4.3	Time Formats
--------------------

The time formats used throughout this manual are specific to Magick. When
specifying a time, you must use a series of numbers and units, the
default unit being seconds.  The valid time units are:
	s = seconds	m = minutes	h = hours
	d = days	w = weeks	y = years

Any number immediately preceeding a unit listed above will be considered
to by of that unit type.  ie. 21s will be considered as 21 seconds, and
21m as 21 minutes.  You may string multiple time units together, ie.
3h15m means 3 hours and 15 minutes.

You may specify numbers higher than 'natural' unit boundaries (ie. 100s
is valid), and you may specify units in any order.  Any numbers without
unit types following them will be assumed to be seconds.

Only positive time values are allowed, and it may not contain spaces.


1.4.4	Space Formats
---------------------

As with time formats, all space formats are specific to Magick.
When specifying a space (or size), you must use a series of numbers
and units, the default unit being bytes.  The valid space units are:
	b = bytes	k = kilobytes	m = megabytes
	g = gigabytes	t = terrabytes

Any number immediately preceeding a unit listed above will be considered
to by of that unit type.  ie. 21b will be considered as 21 bytes, and
21k as 21 kilobytes.  You may string multiple time units together, ie.
3k80b means 3 kilobytes and 15 bytes.

You may specify numbers higher than 'natural' unit boundaries (ie. 2000b
is valid), and you may specify units in any order.  Any numbers without
unit types following them will be assumed to be bytes.

Only positive space values are allowed, and it may not contain spaces.


1.5	Documentation Key
=========================

Any parameter in <> braces are required.
Any parameter in [] braces are optional.

A pipe (|) in the parameter indicates that you may use any one of the
listed options, but only one.


1.5.1	Committee Membership
----------------------------

Magick as of version 2.0 is committee based.  All commands and extra
features of commands are bound to committees memberships.  By default,
there are 6 committees that are used to determine who can use any
command in services, they are:

ALL	All currently online users (dynamic membership).
REGD	All users with registered nicknames (dynamic membership).
OPER	IRC Operators (added by the ADMIN committee).
ADMIN	Server Administrators (added by the SADMIN committee).
SOP	Services Operators (added by the SADMIN committee).
SADMIN	Services Admins (listed in the configuration file).

The actual names of the above committees may be anything, but these are
the default names, and what is used throughout this document.  Through
either code changes, or usage of the scripting language however, the
access required for each command may be changed to any committee desired,
even non-default committees.

There are also many commands that have extended features for members of
privileged committees throughout services.  The actual committee that
is required to use these extended commands is defined in the Magick
configuration file.  The override types available are:

OVR_VIEW	The ability to view private lists (eg. an access list).
OVR_OWNER	The ability to change who owns something.
OVR_CS_MODE	The ability to use the MODE (3.1.7) command to set a mode.
OVR_CS_OP	The ability to OP / DEOP (3.1.10) someone.
OVR_CS_HALFOP	The ability to HALFOP / DEHALFOP (3.1.11) someone.
OVR_CS_VOICE	The ability to VOICE / DEVOICE (3.1.12) someone.
OVR_CS_INVITE	The ability to INVITE (3.1.8) someone to a channel.
OVR_CS_UNBAN	The ability to UNBAN (3.1.9) someone from a channel.
OVR_CS_CLEAR	The ability to use the CLEAR (3.1.13) command.

Throughout this document, we will mention a requirement to be in either
one of the 6 default committees, or one of the 8 override 'committees'.
Remember that the override committees are not actual committees, but
just names used to represent an actual committee, due to the fact that
the actual committee name may be changed in the configuration file.


==========================================================================
  Section 2 - NickServ
==========================================================================

NickServ is a service that allows people to register and maintain their
nicknames.  Most commands that NickServ offers may only performed on
registered nicknames.

NickServ is usually the name used for this service, however it may
be called anything the network administrators of your network decide
to call it.  Common names are NickServ, NickS and NickOP.  All
commands to NickServ are done through private messages, or queries.
This document will assume you know how to send a private message.


2.1	Extended Commands
=========================

Many of the commands that are available to users (see user.txt) have some
extra features available to members of the privileged committees only.
Some of these extra features may just be the ability to execute a command
on another user's nickname that normally only they could execute on
themselves, however some commands add entirely new functionality.


2.1.1	DROP
------------

SYNTAX: DROP <nickname>

This will drop the nickname specified.  This works just as if the nickname
themselves had identified and executed the DROP command.  Normal users
may also specify a nickname as a parameter to the DROP command, however
they are restricted to only dropping linked nicknames.  You may not drop
the nickname of any member of the OPER or SOP committees, they must be
removed from these committees first.

NOTE: that if you forget the nickname parameter, then you will end up
dropping your own nickname, so be careful!

You must be on the SOP committee to use this command syntax.


2.1.2	SLAVES
--------------

SYNTAX: SLAVES <nickname>

This will give you a list of all linked nicknames that are associated
with the specified nickname (whether it is the host or not).  It works
exactly like the normal SLAVES command, however normal users may not
see the slaves of another user.

You must be on the OVR_VIEW committee to use this command syntax.


2.1.3	LIST
------------

SYNTAX: LIST [nickmask [maximum]]
        LISTNOEXP [nickmask [maximum]]
        LISTFORBID [nickmask [maximum]]
        LISTSUSP [nickmask [maximum]]

In all cases, the LIST commands works exactly as it does for normal users.
However for members of the OPER committee, even nicknames with PRIVATE
set on will be displayed in the list.

For members of the SOP committee, 3 new subcommands are made available.
LISTNOEXP will only display nicknames with the NOEXPIRE flag set.
LISTFORBID will only display forbidden nicknames.
LISTSUSP will only display suspended nicknames.


2.1.4	ACCESS
--------------

SYNTAX: ACCESS LIST <nickname>

This works just like the normal ACCESS LIST command, however you may view
the access list of ANY user, not just yourself.

You must be on the OVR_VIEW committee to use this command syntax.


2.1.5	IGNORE
--------------

SYNTAX: IGNORE LIST <nickname>

This works just like the normal IGNORE LIST command, however you may view
the ignore list of ANY user, not just yourself.

You must be on the OVR_VIEW committee to use this command syntax.


2.2	Added Commands
======================

These commands are not available to normal users.  All these commands
require special privileges.


2.2.1	LIVE
------------

SYNTAX: LIVE [hostmask [maximum]]
        LIVEOPER [hostmask [maximum]]

LIVE will list out all nicknames currently online that match the
hostmask specified up to the maximum number of nicknames specified.
If neither is specified, the default hostmask is *!*@*, and the default
maximum is set in the Magick configuration people.  There is also an
absolute maximum above which you may not set your maximum to, which is
also set in the Magick configuration file.
LIVEOPER will do the same as LIST, however only users with mode +o
(IRC operators) will be displayed.

You must be on the SOP committee to use this command.


2.2.2	SETPASS
---------------

SYNTAX: SETPASS <nickname> <password>

This will change the password of the nickname specified to the password
you specify.  A global notice will be sent out to warn people that you
have done this.

You must be on the SOP committee to use this command.


2.2.3	GETPASS
---------------

SYNTAX: GETPASS <nickname> <password>

This will retrieve and display the password of the nickname specified.
A global notice will be sent out to warn people that you have done this.
NOTE: This may not be available - this feature must be specifically
compiled into magick, so if this has not been done, this will not work.

You must be on the SADMIN committee to use this command.


2.2.4	SUSPEND
---------------

SYNTAX: SUSPEND <nickname> <reason>

This will suspend a nickname with the reason specified.  When suspended,
the user will not be able to identify, and therefore will not be able to
do many things that require identification (including dropping the nick).
Because of the fact the user cannot identify, the nickname will also be
exempt from expiry.  The user's INFO display will indicate that the
user is suspended.  The suspension reason is stored in the user's comment.

This feature is meant as a short-term judicial action, and prolonged
nickname suspension is not recommended, use FORBID (2.2.6) for this.

You must be on the SOP committee to use this command.


2.2.5	UNSUSPEND
-----------------

SYNTAX: UNSUSPEND <nickname>

This will reverse the effect of the SUSPEND (2.2.4) command.  The user
will once again be subject to nickname expiry, and will be able to
identify to their nickname again.  The comment field however will keep
the suspension reason in it for future reference.

You must be on the SOP committee to use this command.


2.2.6	FORBID
--------------

SYNTAX: FORBID <nickname>

This will forbid a nickname from being used at all.  If a user who does
not have mode +o on attempts to use a forbidden nickname, they will be
warned that they must chose another nickname, or be killed or renamed.

If the nickname specified is already registered, it will be dropped first,
therefore you may not forbid a nickname currently in use by a member of
the OPER or SOP committees.

You must be on the SOP committee to use this command.


2.2.7	SET COMMENT
-------------------

SYNTAX: SET COMMENT <nickname> <comment>

This will set the comment field of a user's record.  The comment field
may be seen by members of the OPER or SOP committees in an INFO display
of the user (all other users cannot).  The comment field doubles as the
suspend reason field when the user is suspended.

Setting this to NONE will clear this field.
You must be on the SOP committee to use this command.


2.2.8	SET NOEXPIRE
--------------------

SYNTAX: SET NOEXPIRE <nickname> <ON|OFF|RESET>

This will turn on or off No Expire on the specified nickname.  When
no expire is on, the user will be exempt from their nickname expiring
due to it not being used in a pre-defined period of time.

Setting this to RESET will set the value to whatever newly registered
	nicknames are set to (ie. the default value).
You must be on the SOP committee to use this command.


2.2.9	DETAIL
--------------

SYNTAX: DETAIL <nickname>

DETAIL will list out all channels a nickname has access to, and
what access that nickname has in each channel.  If the nickname
is the founder of the channel, the access level will show up as
'F'.  If they are the co-founder of the channel, a 'C' will be
appended to their access level in the channel.

You must be on the SOP committee to use this command.


2.3	Locking and Unlocking
=============================

Sometimes it is necessary to stop a user from being able to change a
particular option, and force them to have it on or off.  This is achieved
with the LOCK and UNLOCK command.  Every LOCK has a reciprocal UNLOCK
command.


2.3.1	PROTECT
---------------

SYNTAX: LOCK PROTECT <nickname> <ON|OFF|RESET>
        UNLOCK PROTECT <nickname>

This will lock or unlock the value of Protect on or off for the specified
nickname.  While locked, the user will not be able to change this value.
When the value is unlocked, it will keep the value it was locked at,
however the user may once again change it as required.  You may not
override or unlock a global lock (ie. a value set as locked in the
Magick configuration file, that is active for all users).

Setting this to RESET will lock the value to whatever newly registered
	nicknames are set to (ie. the default value).
You must be on the SOP committee to use this command.


2.3.2	SECURE
--------------

SYNTAX: LOCK SECURE <nickname> <ON|OFF|RESET>
        UNLOCK SECURE <nickname>

This will lock or unlock the value of Secure on or off for the specified
nickname.  While locked, the user will not be able to change this value.
When the value is unlocked, it will keep the value it was locked at,
however the user may once again change it as required.  You may not
override or unlock a global lock (ie. a value set as locked in the
Magick configuration file, that is active for all users).

Setting this to RESET will lock the value to whatever newly registered
	nicknames are set to (ie. the default value).
You must be on the SOP committee to use this command.


2.3.3	NOMEMO
--------------

SYNTAX: LOCK NOMEMO <nickname> <ON|OFF|RESET>
        UNLOCK NOMEMO <nickname>

This will lock or unlock the value of No Memo on or off for the specified
nickname.  While locked, the user will not be able to change this value.
When the value is unlocked, it will keep the value it was locked at,
however the user may once again change it as required.  You may not
override or unlock a global lock (ie. a value set as locked in the
Magick configuration file, that is active for all users).

Setting this to RESET will lock the value to whatever newly registered
	nicknames are set to (ie. the default value).
You must be on the SOP committee to use this command.


2.3.4	PRIVATE
---------------

SYNTAX: LOCK PRIVATE <nickname> <ON|OFF|RESET>
        UNLOCK PRIVATE <nickname>

This will lock or unlock the value of Private on or off for the specified
nickname.  While locked, the user will not be able to change this value.
When the value is unlocked, it will keep the value it was locked at,
however the user may once again change it as required.  You may not
override or unlock a global lock (ie. a value set as locked in the
Magick configuration file, that is active for all users).

Setting this to RESET will lock the value to whatever newly registered
	nicknames are set to (ie. the default value).
You must be on the SOP committee to use this command.


2.3.5	PRIVMSG
---------------

SYNTAX: LOCK PRIVMSG <nickname> <ON|OFF|RESET>
        UNLOCK PRIVMSG <nickname>

This will lock or unlock the value of PRIVMSG on or off for the specified
nickname.  While locked, the user will not be able to change this value.
When the value is unlocked, it will keep the value it was locked at,
however the user may once again change it as required.  You may not
override or unlock a global lock (ie. a value set as locked in the
Magick configuration file, that is active for all users).

Setting this to RESET will lock the value to whatever newly registered
	nicknames are set to (ie. the default value).
You must be on the SOP committee to use this command.


2.3.6	LANGUAGE
----------------

SYNTAX: LOCK LANGUAGE <nickname> <language|RESET>
        UNLOCK LANGUAGE <nickname>

This will lock or unlock the value of Language to the specified value
for the specified nickname.  While locked, the user will not be able to
change this value.  When the value is unlocked, it will keep the value it
was locked at, however the user may once again change it as required.
You may not override or unlock a global lock (ie. a value set as locked
in the Magick configuration file, that is active for all users).

Setting this to RESET will lock the value to whatever newly registered
	nicknames are set to (ie. the default value).
You must be on the SOP committee to use this command.

==========================================================================

ChanServ is a service that allows people to register and maintain their
channels.  Most commands that ChanServ offers may only performed on
registered channels, by registered nicknames.

ChanServ is usually the name used for this service, however it may
be called anything the network administrators of your network decide
to call it.  Common names are ChanServ, ChanS and ChanOP.  All
commands to ChanServ are done through private messages, or queries.
This document will assume you know how to send a private message.


3.1	Extended Commands
=========================

Many of the commands that are available to users (see user.txt) have some
extra features available to members of the privileged committees only.
Some of these extra features may just be the ability to execute a command
on another user's nickname that normally only they could execute on
themselves, however some commands add entirely new functionality.


3.1.1	DROP
------------

SYNTAX: DROP <channel>

This will drop the channel specified.  This works just as if the founder

SYNTAX: LIST [channelmask [maximum]]
        LISTNOEXP [channelmask [maximum]]
        LISTFORBID [channelmask [maximum]]
        LISTSUSP [channelmask [maximum]]

In all cases, the LIST commands works exactly as it does for normal users.
However for members of the OPER committee, even channels with PRIVATE set
on will be displayed in the list.

For members of the SOP committee, 3 new subcommands are made available.
LISTNOEXP will only display channels with the NOEXPIRE flag set.
LISTFORBID will only display forbidden channels.
LISTSUSP will only display suspended channels.


3.1.3	ACCESS
--------------

SYNTAX: ACCESS <channel> LIST

on.

You must be on the OVR_VIEW committee to use this command syntax.


3.1.4	AKICK
-------------

SYNTAX: AKICK <channel> LIST

This works just like the normal AKICK LIST command, however you may view
the auto kick list of ANY channel, not just ones you have AKICK
privileges on.

You must be on the OVR_VIEW committee to use this command syntax.


3.1.5	GREET
-------------

SYNTAX: GREET <channel> LIST <nickname|ALL>

This works just like the normal GREET LIST command, however you may view

privileges on.

You must be on the OVR_VIEW committee to use this command syntax.


3.1.7	MODE
------------

SYNTAX: MODE <channel> [mode [parameters]]

When no mode or parameters is specified, this will display the modes
currently active for the channel specified.  You must have OVR_VIEW
privileges to use this command with no mode.

specified modes in the channel specified.  You must have OVR_CS_MODE
privileges to use this command with a mode.


3.1.8	INVITE
--------------

SYNTAX: INVITE <channel> <nickname>

This will have ChanServ invite the given nickname to the specified
channel.  You may specify your own nickname.

maximum is set in the Magick configuration people.  There is also an
absolute maximum above which you may not set your maximum to, which is
also set in the Magick configuration file.

You must be on the SOP committee to use this command.


3.2.2	SETPASS
---------------

You must be on the SADMIN committee to use this command.


3.2.4	SUSPEND
---------------

SYNTAX: SUSPEND <channel> <reason>

This will suspend a channel with the reason specified.  When suspended,
the access list of the channel becomes useless, and the topic of the
channel is locked to display the channel is suspended, and why.  While
suspended, members of the SADMIN committee have founder access, members
of the SOP committee have whatever SUPER is set to, members of the ADMIN
committee have whatever AUTOOP is set to, and members of the OPER
committee have whatever AUTOVOICE is set to, all other user have nothing.
The user's INFO display will indicate that the channel is suspended.
The suspension reason is stored in the channel's comment.  The channel
will not be subject to expiry while it is suspended.

This feature is meant as a short-term judicial action, and prolonged
channel suspension is not recommended, use FORBID (3.2.6) for this.

You must be on the SOP committee to use this command.

may be seen by members of the OPER or SOP committees in an INFO display
of the user (all other users cannot).  The comment field doubles as the
suspend reason field when the channel is suspended.

Setting this to NONE will clear this field.
You must be on the SOP committee to use this command.


3.2.8	SET NOEXPIRE
--------------------

SYNTAX: SET <channel> NOEXPIRE <ON|OFF|RESET>

==========================================================================
  Section 4 - CommServ
==========================================================================

CommServ is a service that allows you to create groups of users for
various purposes - mainly contactability purposes.  Committees control
everything from what commands may be used in services, to what messages
are seen when people sign online.

CommServ is usually the name used for this service, however it may
be called anything the network administrators of your network decide
to call it.  Since CommServ is unique to Magick, there are no other
commonly known names for CommServ.  All commands to MemoServ are done
through private messages, or queries.  This document will assume you
know how to send a private message.


4.1	Extended Commands
=========================

Many of the commands that are available to users (see user.txt) have some
extra features available to members of the privileged committees only.
Some of these extra features may just be the ability to execute a command
on another user's nickname that normally only they could execute on
themselves, however some commands add entirely new functionality.


4.1.1	LIST
------------

The LIST command works exactly as it does for normal users, however for
members of the OPER committee, even committees with PRIVATE set on will
be displayed in the list.


4.1.2	MEMBER
--------------

SYNTAX: SET <committee> HEAD <nickname|@committee>

This will transfer ownership of a committee to another user or committee. 
No other changes are made except who services see as the head.  If a
nickname is specified it must be registered.  If a committee is specified
prefixed by an '@' symbol, it too must be registered, and all members of
that committee will be considered heads of the one you are changing.

You must be on the OVR_OWNER committee to use this command syntax.


4.2	Added Commands
======================

These commands are not available to normal users.  All these commands
require special privileges.


4.2.1	ADD
-----------

SYNTAX: ADD <committee> <nickname|@committee> <description>

gain change it as required.  You may not override or unlock a global
lock (ie. a value set as locked in the Magick configuration file, that
is active for all committees).

Setting this to RESET will lock the value to whatever newly registered
	committees are set to (ie. the default value).
You must be on the SOP committee to use this command.

	committees are set to (ie. the default value).
You must be on the SOP committee to use this command.


==========================================================================
  Section 5 - HelpServ
==========================================================================

HelpServ is a service that fulfills an entirely informational purpose.
This service is also the global noticer (the service used for sending
out messages to all users when necessary).

HelpServ is usually the name used for this service, however it may
be called anything the network administrators of your network decide
to call it.  Common names are HelpServ, HepS and HelpOP.  All
commands to HelpServ are done through private messages, or queries.
This document will assume you know how to send a private message.


5.1	Extended Commands
=========================

Many of the commands that are available to users (see user.txt) have some
extra features available to members of the privileged committees only.
Some of these extra features may just be the ability to execute a command
on another user's nickname that normally only they could execute on
themselves, however some commands add entirely new functionality.

        FILE DCC
        FILE CANCEL <dcc>
        FILE LOOKUP <type> <hexfile>

This command is used to do all maintenence functions on the Public File
System in Magick, and all DCC's in progress.

LIST works the same way as with users, however SOP's will also be able
	to see ALL files (not just what they have access to), and what
	committees may download each file.
ADD will add a new file to the Public File System.  Services will ask
	you to initiate a DCC session with the file you wish to upload
	into the public file system.  The file name will be the same as
	the file uploaded.  If no committees are specified with this
	command, a committee of ALL is assumed.  You must be on the SOP
	committee to use this command.
DEL will remove a file from the Public File System.  This file can not
	be restored once removed.  You must be on the SOP committee to
	use this command.
RENAME will rename a file from one name to another.  No other change
	will take place except what the file name presented to those who
	have access to download it is (the file name on disk will remain
	the same).  You must be on the SOP committee to use this command.
SECURE will change who has access to download the file specified.  If no
	committees are specified, then the file will be changed so that
	ALL users may download it.  You must be on the SOP committee to
	use this command.  You must be on the SOP committee to use this
	command.
DCC will list all currently active DCC transfers with services.  This

	obtained with the DCC command).  The user will receive an
	internal systems error.  You must be on the SOP committee to use
	this command.
LOOKUP will look up the information in the file storage database about
	any given file on the hard disk.  You must specify the type of
	file you wish to look up (either MemoAttach, Picture or Public),
	and the file name in question.  The information supplied includes
	who 'owns' the file, etc.  eg. a lookup on Picture file 00000001
	would tell you that it is User's picture.
	You must be on the SADMIN committee to use this command.


5.1.2	STATS
-------------

SYNTAX: STATS NICK [CLEAR]
        STATS CHANNEL [CLEAR]
        STATS OTHER [CLEAR]
        STATS OPER [CLEAR]
        STATS USAGE
        STATS ALL [CLEAR]

This command will give you various statistics on services.  Mostly these
consist only of command usage.  A user may not use any subcommands with
the STATS command.  You must be on the SOP committee to use this command,
and on the SADMIN committee to use the CLEAR parameter where available.

NICK will tell you how many registered, linked, suspended and forbidden
	nicknames there are, as well as command usage for most non-
	informational NickServ commands.
CHANNEL will tell you how many registered, suspended and forbidden
	channels there are, as well as command usage for most non-
	informational ChanServ commands.
OTHER will tell you how many memos, news articles, and committees there
	are, as well as command usage for most non-informational
	MemoServ, CommServ and HelpServ commands.
OPER will tell you how many clone overrides, auto kills, services
	ignores and IRC operator denys there are, as well as command
	usage for most non-informational OperServ commands.
USAGE will tell you how much CPU time services has used, and how much
	traffic has been through sent and received by services.  It
	will also list how many live nicknames, stored nicknames, live
	channels, stored channels, memos, news articles, committees,
	OperServ list (clone override, auto kill, services ignore and
	IRC operator deny combined) entries, and some other small list
	entries exist, and how much memory they consume.  Finally this
	will tell you which language (LNG) and help (HLP) files are
	loaded, and how much memory they consume.
ALL will execute ALL of the above commands.

OperServ is a service that allows IRC operators and services staff to
maintain control over the entire IRC network, from things as simple as
removing users from the network, to disabling parts of services.

OperServ is usually the name used for this service, however it may
be called anything the network administrators of your network decide
to call it.  Common names are OperServ, OperS and OperOP.  All
commands to OperServ are done through private messages, or queries.
This document will assume you know how to send a private message.


6.1	IRC Operators
=====================

Although an IRC operator is technically anyone who can set mode +o on the
network, for the purposes of services, IRC operators are anyone who is
a member of the OPER committee.  Members of the OPER committee are added
by members of the ADMIN committee.  Services may or may not require you
to actually have mode +o set to be recognized as being on the OPER
committee (so not all members of the OPER committee must be IRC
operators).  You may or may not also have to identify to your nickname to
identify to be recognized as being on the OPER committee.

Not all parts of every command listed in this section are available to
members of the OPER committee, however all commands in this section may
be used by members of the OPER committee in some fashion.


6.1.1	HELP
------------

SYNTAX: HELP [command]

This will give you detailed help on the syntax of a command, and describe
what it does.  For subcommands, just separate the command and subcommand
with a space.

You must be on the OPER or SOP committee to use this command.


6.1.2	CLONE
-------------

SYNTAX: CLONE ADD <host> <amount> <reason>
        CLONE DEL <host|number>
        CLONE LIST [mask]

This maintains the clone override list.  The clone override list is
simply a list of hosts (no nicknames or idents, however wildcards are
allowed), the amount of clones allowed to log on from that host, and why
the override is in place.  The amount of clones allowed must at least be
between 1 and the maximum allowable override amount set in the Magick
configuration file.

ADD will add a new host to the clone override list.
DEL will remove either a host or the numbered entry from the clone
	override list.  The entry numbers are shown on a LIST.
You must be on the SOP committee to use the ADD and DEL commands.
LIST will list out all current entries on the clone override list.
	If mask is specified, only entries matching it will be
	listed, wildcards allowed.  You must be on the OPER or SOP
	committee to use this command.


6.1.3	AKILL
-------------

SYNTAX: AKILL ADD <hostmask> [[+]time] <reason>
        AKILL DEL <hostmask|number>
        AKILL LIST [mask]

This maintains the auto kill list.  The auto kill list is simply a list
of hostmasks (no nicknames, however wildcards are allowed), the time they
should remain killed (from the time of last modification), and why they
have been killed.  The maximum time allowable is different for each
committee, and set in the Magick configuration file.

ADD will add a new hostmask to the auto kill list.
DEL will remove either a hostmask or the numbered entry from the
	auto kill list.  The entry numbers are shown on a LIST.
LIST will list out all current entries on the auto kill list.
	If mask is specified, only entries matching it will be
	listed, wildcards allowed.

You must be on the OPER or SOP committees to use this command.


6.1.4	IGNORE
--------------

SYNTAX: IGNORE ADD <hostmask|nickname>
        IGNORE DEL <hostmask|number>
        IGNORE LIST [mask]

This maintains the services ignore list.  The services ignore list is
simply a list of hostmasks (wildcards allowed) that services will not
respond to under any circumstances.  Users who trip flood protection
can be temporarily added to the services ignore list, however only
after tripping the services flood protection several times in a specific
time limit (the amount and time limit are in the Magick configuration
file) will they be added to this permanently.  LIST will not display
temporary ignores, nor can you add or delete them.

ADD will add a new hostmask to the services ignore list.  If a nickname
	is specified and that nickname is online, the default ignore
	hostmask based on that user will be used.
DEL will remove either a hostmask or the numbered entry from the
	services ignore list.  The entry numbers are shown on a LIST.
You must be on the SOP committee to use the ADD and DEL commands.
LIST will list out all current entries on the services ignore list.
	If mask is specified, only entries matching it will be
	listed, wildcards allowed.  You must be on the OPER or SOP
	committee to use this command.


6.1.5	MODE
------------

SYNTAX: MODE <nickname|channel> [modes]

This will view the current modes of, or set a mode on a currently active
nickname or channel.  If no modes are specified, then the currently
active modes for the nickname or channel are returned, otherwise the
specified modes will be set for the nickname or channel.  Setting modes
on a nickname may or may not be supported by the IRC server software in
use on the network.

You must be on the OPER committee to use this command except for setting
a mode on a nickname (if supported), which requires the SOP committee.


6.1.6	PING
------------

SYNTAX: PING

This will force services to send a PING message to all servers currently
linked to the network.  This has no real effect except updating the lag
times listed in the HelpServ BREAKDOWN command.

You must be on the OPER or SOP committees to use this command.


6.1.7	SETTINGS
----------------

SYNTAX: SETTINGS CONFIG
        SETTINGS NICK
        SETTINGS CHANNEL
        SETTINGS OTHER
        SETTINGS ALL

This will show you what the current settings are of most items in the
Magick configuration file.  This is where you will find out most limits,
maximums, etc.

CONFIG will show general configuration information relating to the level
	services operates at, how many places it will link, how often
	it will perform its tasks, and DCC thresholds.
NICK will show all information regarding nicknames, including how long
	until they expire, time limits and thresholds for identification,
	default options, and file storage information.
CHANNEL will show all information regarding channels, including how long
	until they expire, time limits, default options, minimum and
	maximum access levels, and how long news articles last.
OTHER will show all information that doesn't quite fit elsewhere,
	including the AKILL maximum time limits, the memo in-flight time,
	maximum clone limits, flood protection and ignore thresholds,
	and the default committee options.
ALL will execute ALL of the above commands.

You must be on the OPER or SOP committees to use this command.


6.2	Services Operators
==========================

A Services Operator is anyone who is a member of the SOP committee.
Members of the SOP committee are added by members of the SADMIN committee.
Services may or may not require you to actually have mode +o set to be
recognized as being on the SOP committee (so not all members of the SOP
committee must be IRC operators).  You may or may not also have to
identify to your nickname to identify be recognized as being on the SOP
committee.

Not all parts of every command listed in this section are available to
members of the SOP committee, however all commands in this section may
be used by members of the SOP committee in some fashion.


6.2.1	OPERDENY
----------------

SYNTAX: OPERDENY ADD <hostmask|nickname> <reason>
        OPERDENY DEL <hostmask|number>
        OPERDENY LIST [hostmask]

This maintains the IRC operator deny list.  The IRC operator deny list
is simply a list of hostmasks (wildcards allowed) that services will not
allow user to set mode +o (ie. become an IRC operator) from.  If any
user attempts to become an IRC operator from a mask on this list, the
IRC operator status will be stripped by services if the IRC server
supports it, or the user will be killed if it doesn't.

ADD will add a new hostmask to the IRC operator deny list.  If a
	nickname is specified and that nickname is online, the
	default ignore hostmask based on that user will be used.
DEL will remove either a hostmask or the numbered entry from the IRC
	operator deny list.  The entry numbers are shown on a LIST.
You must be on the SADMIN committee to use the ADD and DEL commands.
LIST will list out all current entries on the IRC operator deny list.
	If mask is specified, only entries matching it will be listed,
	wildcards allowed.  You must be on the SOP committee to use
	this command.


6.2.2	HTM
-----------

SYNTAX: HTM ON
        HTM OFF
        HTM SET <size>

This will manage services High Traffic Mode.  While in High Traffic Mode
various commands will be disabled, mainly ones that incur a large amount
of response messages from services.  The aim of High Traffic Mode is to
temporarily retard services in an effort to reduce bandwidth usage to
until the higher bandwidth usage subsides.  High Traffic Mode will
activate on its own when the average traffic over 5 seconds goes above the
HTM threshold.  Once this happens, the sampling window will increase by
2 seconds (ie. become 7 seconds) at the end of which the average traffic
is measured again.  If the traffic has not subsided by the time the
sampling window has exceeded 60 seconds, services will disconnect.

ON will force High Traffic Mode on, and set the sampling window to 30
	seconds.  This works exactly the same as if the sampling window
	had gradually risen to 30 seconds.  A global message will be
	sent announcing that High Traffic Mode was forced on.
OFF will force High Traffic Mode off, and the sampling window will be
	set back to 5 seconds.  A global message will be sent announcing
	that High Traffic Mode was forced off.
SET will change the traffic threshold at which High Traffic Mode will
	activate.  This value should be in Magick's own Space Format
	(1.4.4).  A global message will be sent announcing that the
	High Traffic Mode threshold was changed, and its new value.

You must be on the SOP committees to use this command.


6.3	IRC Administrators
==========================

Although an IRC administrator is technically anyone who runs an IRC
server on the network, for the purposes of services, IRC administrators
are anyone who is a member of the ADMIN committee.  Members of the ADMIN
committee are added by members of the SADMIN committee.  Services may or
may not require you to actually have mode +o set to be recognized as
being on the ADMIN committee (so not all members of the OPER committee
must be IRC operators).  You may or may not also have to identify to your
nickname be recognized as being on the ADMIN committee.

Not all parts of every command listed in this section are available to
members of the ADMIN committee, however all commands in this section may
be used by members of the ADMIN committee in some fashion.


6.3.1	QLINE / UNQLINE
-----------------------

SYNTAX: QLINE <nickmask> [reason]
        UNQLINE <nickmask>

This will forbid or re-allow any nickname matching the specified nickmask
(wildcards allowed) from signing onto the network.  Forbidding a nickname
on all servers may or may not be supported by the IRC server software in
use on the network.

You must be on the ADMIN committees to use this command.


6.3.2	NOOP
------------

SYNTAX: NOOP <server> <ON|OFF>

This will restrict all IRC operators on the specified server to local
IRC operator powers only.  The server specified must currently be
linked to the network.  Restricting IRC operators on a server to local
IRC operator powers may or may not be supported by the IRC server
software in use on the network.

You must be on the ADMIN committees to use this command.


6.3.3	JUPE
------------

SYNTAX: JUPE <server> <reason>

This will make a server appear to be linked to the network via. services,
forcing any server trying to link with that name to receive an "Already
Linked" message.  This is most often used to stop a misconfigured server
from continually linking and dropping out.  The reason specified will
appear as part of the server 'description' along with an indication that
it is a juped server.

You must be on the ADMIN committees to use this command.


6.3.4	KILL
------------

SYNTAX: KILL <nickname> <reason>

This will kill a user with no trace that an IRC operator was responsible,
aka. a 'silent' kill.  A global notice will be sent to indicate this
command has been used.  Killing a user with no indication of any
IRC operator interaction may or may not be supported by the IRC server
software in use on the network.

You must be on the ADMIN committees to use this command.


6.3.5	HIDE
------------

SYNTAX: HIDE <nickname> <host>

This will alter the host of the specified nickname to be the specified
host.  This should be used with caution, as changing a hostmask may
affect such operations as DCC.  Altering a user's host may or may not
not be supported by the IRC server software in use on the network.

You must be on the ADMIN committees to use this command.


6.4	Services Administrators
===============================

A Services Administrator is anyone who is a member of the SADMIN
committee.  Members of the SADMIN committee are listed in the Magick
configuration file.  Services may or may not require you to actually
have mode +o set to be recognized as being on the SOP committee (so not
all members of the SADMIN committee must be IRC operators).  You may or
may not also have to identify to your nickname to identify be recognized
as being on the SADMIN committee.


6.4.1	TRACE
-------------

SYNTAX: TRACE UP <type> <level|names...>
        TRACE DOWN <type> <level|names...>
        TRACE SET <type> <level|names...>

Tracing is an advanced feature of services that allows almost everything
services does to be tracked.  Magick is coded with special trace coding
inside it that allows files to be created with everything from code check
points, comments, data modifications, all the way up to all traffic to
and from services, what functions are being executed, and what locks
services are setting and removing throughout its execution.  If you don't
know what it does, you probably don't need it, as it is more of a tool to
debug services than for general usage.

The valid types for this command are:
MAIN	Events, incoming (unclassified) data, etc.
NS	NickServ processing (/MSG NickServ)
CS	ChanServ processing (/MSG ChanServ)
MS	MemoServ processing (/MSG MemoServ)
OS	OperServ processing (/MSG OperServ)
XS	All other services processing
NET	Inter-Magick data, processing, etc.
SCRIPT	Script (and scripted services) processing
MBASE	Server data (ie. IRCD interface)
LOST	Anything not in the above
ALL	All of the above

The valid trace levels and names for this command are:
0x0000	Off		No tracing.
0x0001	Stats		Statistical displays only
0x0002	Source		Reading source files (cfg, scripts)
0x0004	Bind		Binding and Unbinding of commands
0x0008			Unused
0x0010	CheckPoint	Pre-defined Checkpoints
0x0020	Comments	More verbose checkpoints
0x0040	Locking		Acquiring and releasing locks
0x0080	Functions	In and out of functions (and params)
0x0100	Changing	What data is changing
0x0200	Modify		An in/out difference of the record
0x0400			Unused
0x0800			Unused
0x1000	Sockets		Socket establishes and disconnects
0x2000	Chatter		Data in and out of a socket
0x4000			Unused
0x8000	External	All output from external calls
0xffff	All		All of the above

UP will add the specified level or names to the current trace level for
	the type specified.
DOWN will remove the specified level or names from the current trace
	level for the type specified.
SET will set the current trace level to the level or names specified.

You must be on the SADMIN committees to use this command.


6.4.2	UNLOAD
--------------

SYNTAX: UNLOAD <language>

This will unload a language file from memory.  It will be automatically
loaded again the first time it is used (so if it is your own language it
will be reloaded immediately).  This is mainly used to effect a change in
the language file.  Both help and language text will be unloaded.

You must be on the SADMIN committees to use this command.


6.4.3	RELOAD
--------------

SYNTAX: RELOAD

This will reload the Magick configuration file.  Services will
automatically will reconnect or sign on and/or off services clients if
changes in the configuration file dictate it is required.

You must be on the SADMIN committees to use this command.


6.4.4	IDENTIFY
----------------

SYNTAX: IDENTIFY <password>

This is exactly the same as the NickServ IDENTIFY command, however it is
available in OperServ also for when messages processing has been turned
OFF (6.4.6), and being recognized as a SADMIN requires identification.

You must be on the SADMIN committees to use this command.


6.4.5	UPDATE
--------------

SYNTAX: UPDATE

This will trigger a database save immediately.  The database is saved
automatically periodically.

You must be on the SADMIN committees to use this command.


6.4.6	ON / OFF
----------------

SYNTAX: ON <AUTO|LOG|MSG [service]>
        OFF <AUTO|LOG|MSG [service]>

This will turn on or off a part of services.  Specifying AUTO will turn
on or off automatic events processing.  This includes nickname, channel,
AKILL and news expiry, all setting of channel modes, server lag checking,
and many other background tasks.  Specifying LOG will turn on or off all
output going to the log file.  Specifying MSG will turn on or off all
interactive message processing by services.  If a service is specified
(ie. OperServ, NickServ, ChanServ, MemoServ, CommServ, ServMsg, or the
primary name of any scripted service), then only all interactive message
processing for that service will be affected.  Even when OperServ message
processing has been turned off, it will still accept the ON, OFF and
IDENTIFY (6.4.4) commands.

You must be on the SADMIN committees to use this command.


6.4.7	SHUTDOWN
----------------

SYNTAX: SHUTDOWN

This will terminate services.  No database save will be done beforehand,
so ensure that databases have been saved using the UPDATE (6.4.5) command
or that you are willing to lose all changes to the data since the last
save.

You must be on the SADMIN committees to use this command.
