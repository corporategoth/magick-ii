<sect>Introduction<label id="Introduction">
<p>

Magick is a program that supplies IRC Services to an IRC Network.  They
connect to the network as if they were a server, and provide 'clients'
that users may interact with to achieve a variety of functions.

These functions include nickname registration, channel registration,
sending memos between users, and functions that allow IRC Operators to
maintain the control and direction of the IRC Network.

Magick is dedicated to the memory of PreZ's loving sister, Stacey Louise
Elder (1st Jan, 1975 - 25th Feb, 1998). She has been there for me more
than anyone over the years, and I was distraught when she died, may her
Lord love her as much as I did, and keep her safe like I could not.
Merry Parting, Dear Sister.

Magick is also dedicated to the memory of Ungod's brother, Edward Kevin
King (28th Aug, 1982 - 21st Nov, 1997), His life was short, but his memory
is great, never will those who knew him forget him.

	<sect1>IRC in General<label id="Intro_IRC_in_General">
	<p>


	Internet Relay Chat (RFC1459) is a very simple protocol designed for user
to user communications.  There are many different types of clients,
servers and services out there for IRC.  Many different chat networks
exist, but the basic methods of joining channels, messaging users, etc is
the same on all of them.

	Most IRC server software tends to be unmoderated -- this means that no
filtering is done by any human or mechanical means that will limit what
you can and cannot say.  This is both a blessing and a curse.  Legally
it means that nothing said or done on IRC is admissible in court, or
can be used as evidence.  However morally, it means that no protections
for children or easily offended people are enforced except voluntarily.

	A very good site dedicated to help on the usage of IRC, how to get on it,
what networks exist, etc is available at http://www.irchelp.org.


		<sect2>Wildcards<label id="Intro_Wildcards">
		<p>

		IRC in general uses two kinds of wildcards throughout its command and
general usage.  These are the * (asterisk) and ? (question mark).  The
* is used to denote 0 or more characters, the characters do not matter.
The ? is used to denote exactly 1 character, again the exact character
does not matter, as long as there's only 1.

		So for example, the host castle.srealm.net.au would match all of these
wildcards:	
		<verb>
				*.srealm.net.au
				*.srealm.???.au
				*.srealm.*.au
				??????.??????.???.??
		</verb>

		</sect2>
		<sect2>Hostmasks<label id="Intro_Hostmasks">
		<p>

		A hostmask is used to depict 2 forms of user identifying information.
These are nickname!user@host or simply user@host, depending on the the
situation where it is used.  The correct format will usually be
specified.

		Each hostmask has at least 2 parts, being the user and host.  These
may be seen when typing /whois nickname.  The user portion is also
known as an 'ident', and is supposed to be the login name the user
is using on the computer they are connecting from, but often it is
meaningless.  The host is the direct address of the computer that
the user is logged onto the internet from.

		Sometimes the nickname may be prepended to the user@host form of
hostmask by putting a '!' after the nickname, ie. nickname!user@host.

		All hostmasks may have wildcards to 'match' more than one variant on
a specific host.  This is mainly used in things such as your access
list, where you may put youruser@*.yourisp.com to match any dialup
line coming from your own ISP.

		</sect2>
		<sect2>Time Formats<label id="Intro_Time_Formats">
		<p>

		The time formats used throughout this manual are specific to Magick. When
specifying a time, you must use a series of numbers and units, the
default unit being seconds.  The valid time units are:
			<tabular ca="l">
				s|second@
				m|minutes@
				h|hours@
				d|days@
				w|weeks@
				y|years@
			</tabular>

		Any number immediately preceeding a unit listed above will be considered
to by of that unit type.  ie. 21s will be considered as 21 seconds, and
21m as 21 minutes.  You may string multiple time units together, ie.
3h15m means 3 hours and 15 minutes.

		You may specify numbers higher than 'natural' unit boundaries (ie. 100s
is valid), and you may specify units in any order.  Any numbers without
unit types following them will be assumed to be seconds.

		Only positive time values are allowed, and it may not contain spaces.

		</sect2>
		<sect2>Space Formats<label id="Intro_Space_Formats">
		<p>

		As with time formats, all space formats are specific to Magick.
When specifying a space (or size), you must use a series of numbers
and units, the default unit being bytes.  The valid space units are:
			<tabular ca="l">
				b|bytes@
				k|kilobytes@
				m|megabytes@
				g|gigabytes@
				t|terrabytes@
			</tabular>

		Any number immediately preceeding a unit listed above will be considered
to by of that unit type.  ie. 21b will be considered as 21 bytes, and
21k as 21 kilobytes.  You may string multiple time units together, ie.
3k80b means 3 kilobytes and 15 bytes.

		You may specify numbers higher than 'natural' unit boundaries (ie. 2000b
is valid), and you may specify units in any order.  Any numbers without
unit types following them will be assumed to be bytes.

		Only positive space values are allowed, and it may not contain spaces.

  </sect1>
  <sect1>Documentation Key<label id="Intro_Documentation_Key">
  <p>


  Any parameter in <lt> braces are required.
  Any parameter in [] braces are optional.

  A pipe (|) in the parameter indicates that you may use any one of the
listed options, but only one.


    <sect2>Committee Membership<label id="Intro_Committee_Membership">
    <p>

    Magick as of version 2.0 is committee based.  All commands and extra
features of commands are bound to committees memberships.  By default,
there are 6 committees that are used to determine who can use any
command in services, they are:
      <tabular ca="l">
      	ALL|All currently online users (dynamic membership).@
      	REGD|All users with registered nicknames (dynamic membership).@
      	OPER|IRC Operators (added by the ADMIN committee).@
      	ADMIN|Server Administrators (added by the SADMIN committee).@
      	SOP|Services Operators (added by the SADMIN committee).@
      	SADMIN|Services Admins (listed in the configuration file).@
      </tabular>
    The actual names of the above committees may be anything, but these are
the default names, and what is used throughout this document.  Through
either code changes, or usage of the scripting language however, the
access required for each command may be changed to any committee desired,
even non-default committees.

    There are also many commands that have extended features for members of
privileged committees throughout services.  The actual committee that
is required to use these extended commands is defined in the Magick
configuration file.  The override types available are:
      <tabular ca="l">
      	OVR_VIEW|The ability to view private lists (eg. an access list).@
      	OVR_OWNER|The ability to change who owns something.@
      	OVR_CS_MODE|The ability to use the MODE (3.1.7) command to set a mode.@
      	OVR_CS_OP|The ability to OP / DEOP (3.1.10) someone.@
      	OVR_CS_HALFOP|The ability to HALFOP / DEHALFOP (3.1.11) someone.@
      	OVR_CS_VOICE|The ability to VOICE / DEVOICE (3.1.12) someone.@
      	OVR_CS_INVITE|The ability to INVITE (3.1.8) someone to a channel.@
      	OVR_CS_UNBAN|The ability to UNBAN (3.1.9) someone from a channel.@
      	OVR_CS_CLEAR|The ability to use the CLEAR (3.1.13) command.@
      </tabular>

    Throughout this document, we will mention a requirement to be in either
one of the 6 default committees, or one of the 8 override 'committees'.
Remember that the override committees are not actual committees, but
just names used to represent an actual committee, due to the fact that
the actual committee name may be changed in the configuration file.

<sect>NickServ<label id="NickServ">
<p>


NickServ is a service that allows people to register and maintain their
nicknames.  Most commands that NickServ offers may only performed on
registered nicknames.

NickServ is usually the name used for this service, however it may
be called anything the network administrators of your network decide
to call it.  Common names are NickServ, NickS and NickOP.  All
commands to NickServ are done through private messages, or queries.
This document will assume you know how to send a private message.


<sect1>Extended Commands<label id="NickServ_Extended_Commands">
<p>


Many of the commands that are available to users (see user.txt) have some
extra features available to members of the privileged committees only.
Some of these extra features may just be the ability to execute a command
on another user's nickname that normally only they could execute on
themselves, however some commands add entirely new functionality.


<sect2>DROP<label id="NickServ_DROP">
<p>

<verb>
SYNTAX: DROP <lt>nickname<gt>
</verb>
This will drop the nickname specified.  This works just as if the nickname
themselves had identified and executed the DROP command.  Normal users
may also specify a nickname as a parameter to the DROP command, however
they are restricted to only dropping linked nicknames.  You may not drop
the nickname of any member of the OPER or SOP committees, they must be
removed from these committees first.

NOTE: that if you forget the nickname parameter, then you will end up
dropping your own nickname, so be careful!

You must be on the SOP committee to use this command syntax.

</sect2>
<sect2>SLAVES<label id="NickServ_SLAVES">
<p>

<verb>
SYNTAX: SLAVES <lt>nickname<gt>
</verb>
This will give you a list of all linked nicknames that are associated
with the specified nickname (whether it is the host or not).  It works
exactly like the normal SLAVES command, however normal users may not
see the slaves of another user.

You must be on the OVR_VIEW committee to use this command syntax.

</sect2>
<sect2>LIST<label id="NickServ_LIST">
<p>

<verb>
SYNTAX: LIST [nickmask [maximum]]
        LISTNOEXP [nickmask [maximum]]
        LISTFORBID [nickmask [maximum]]
        LISTSUSP [nickmask [maximum]]
</verb>
In all cases, the LIST commands works exactly as it does for normal users.
However for members of the OPER committee, even nicknames with PRIVATE
set on will be displayed in the list.

For members of the SOP committee, 3 new subcommands are made available.
<descrip>
<tag/LISTNOEXP/ will only display nicknames with the NOEXPIRE flag set.
<tag/LISTFORBID/ will only display forbidden nicknames.
<tag/LISTSUSP/ will only display suspended nicknames.
</descrip>

</sect2>
<sect2>ACCESS<label id="NickServ_ACCESS">
<p>

<verb>
SYNTAX: ACCESS LIST <lt>nickname<gt>
</verb>
This works just like the normal ACCESS LIST command, however you may view
the access list of ANY user, not just yourself.

You must be on the OVR_VIEW committee to use this command syntax.

</sect2>
<sect2>IGNORE<label id="NickServ_IGNORE">
<p>

<verb>
SYNTAX: IGNORE LIST <lt>nickname<gt>
</verb>
This works just like the normal IGNORE LIST command, however you may view
the ignore list of ANY user, not just yourself.

You must be on the OVR_VIEW committee to use this command syntax.

</sect1>
<sect1>Added Commands<label id="NickServ_Added_Commands">
<p>


These commands are not available to normal users.  All these commands
require special privileges.


<sect2>LIVE<label id="NickServ_LIVE">
<p>

<verb>
SYNTAX: LIVE [hostmask [maximum]]
        LIVEOPER [hostmask [maximum]]
</verb>
LIVE will list out all nicknames currently online that match the
hostmask specified up to the maximum number of nicknames specified.
If neither is specified, the default hostmask is *!*@*, and the default
maximum is set in the Magick configuration people.  There is also an
absolute maximum above which you may not set your maximum to, which is
also set in the Magick configuration file.
LIVEOPER will do the same as LIST, however only users with mode +o
(IRC operators) will be displayed.

You must be on the SOP committee to use this command.

</sect2>
<sect2>SETPASS<label id="NickServ_SETPASS">
<p>

<verb>
SYNTAX: SETPASS <lt>nickname<gt> <lt>password>
</verb>
This will change the password of the nickname specified to the password
you specify.  A global notice will be sent out to warn people that you
have done this.

You must be on the SOP committee to use this command.

</sect2>
<sect2>GETPASS<label id="NickServ_GETPASS">
<p>

<verb>
SYNTAX: GETPASS <lt>nickname<gt> <lt>password>
</verb>
This will retrieve and display the password of the nickname specified.
A global notice will be sent out to warn people that you have done this.
NOTE: This may not be available - this feature must be specifically
compiled into magick, so if this has not been done, this will not work.

You must be on the SADMIN committee to use this command.

</sect2>
<sect2>SUSPEND<label id="NickServ_SUSPEND">
<p>

<verb>
SYNTAX: SUSPEND <lt>nickname<gt> <lt>reason<gt>
</verb>
This will suspend a nickname with the reason specified.  When suspended,
the user will not be able to identify, and therefore will not be able to
do many things that require identification (including dropping the nick).
Because of the fact the user cannot identify, the nickname will also be
exempt from expiry.  The user's INFO display will indicate that the
user is suspended.  The suspension reason is stored in the user's comment.

This feature is meant as a short-term judicial action, and prolonged
nickname suspension is not recommended, use FORBID (2.2.6) for this.

You must be on the SOP committee to use this command.

</sect2>
<sect2>UNSUSPEND<label id="NickServ_UNSUSPEND">
<p>

<verb>
SYNTAX: UNSUSPEND <lt>nickname<gt>
</verb>
This will reverse the effect of the SUSPEND (2.2.4) command.  The user
will once again be subject to nickname expiry, and will be able to
identify to their nickname again.  The comment field however will keep
the suspension reason in it for future reference.

You must be on the SOP committee to use this command.


<sect2>FORBID<label id="NickServ_FORBID">
<p>

<verb>
SYNTAX: FORBID <lt>nickname<gt>
</verb>
This will forbid a nickname from being used at all.  If a user who does
not have mode +o on attempts to use a forbidden nickname, they will be
warned that they must chose another nickname, or be killed or renamed.

If the nickname specified is already registered, it will be dropped first,
therefore you may not forbid a nickname currently in use by a member of
the OPER or SOP committees.

You must be on the SOP committee to use this command.

</sect2>
<sect2>SET COMMENT<label id="NickServ_SET_COMMENT">
<p>

<verb>
SYNTAX: SET COMMENT <lt>nickname<gt> <lt>comment>
</verb>
This will set the comment field of a user's record.  The comment field
may be seen by members of the OPER or SOP committees in an INFO display
of the user (all other users cannot).  The comment field doubles as the
suspend reason field when the user is suspended.

Setting this to NONE will clear this field.
You must be on the SOP committee to use this command.

</sect2>
<sect2>SET NOEXPIRE<label id="NickServ_SET_NOEXPIRE">
<p>

<verb>
SYNTAX: SET NOEXPIRE <lt>nickname<gt> <lt>ON|OFF|RESET<gt>
</verb>
This will turn on or off No Expire on the specified nickname.  When
no expire is on, the user will be exempt from their nickname expiring
due to it not being used in a pre-defined period of time.

Setting this to RESET will set the value to whatever newly registered
	nicknames are set to (ie. the default value).
You must be on the SOP committee to use this command.

</sect2>
</sect1>
<sect1>Locking and Unlocking<label id="NickServ_Locking_and_Unlocking">
<p>

Sometimes it is necessary to stop a user from being able to change a
particular option, and force them to have it on or off.  This is achieved
with the LOCK and UNLOCK command.  Every LOCK has a reciprocal UNLOCK
command.


<sect2>PROTECT<label id="NickServ_PROTECT">
<p>

<verb>
SYNTAX: LOCK PROTECT <lt>nickname<gt> <lt>ON|OFF|RESET<gt>
</verb>        UNLOCK PROTECT <lt>nickname<gt>

This will lock or unlock the value of Protect on or off for the specified
nickname.  While locked, the user will not be able to change this value.
When the value is unlocked, it will keep the value it was locked at,
however the user may once again change it as required.  You may not
override or unlock a global lock (ie. a value set as locked in the
Magick configuration file, that is active for all users).

Setting this to RESET will lock the value to whatever newly registered
	nicknames are set to (ie. the default value).
You must be on the SOP committee to use this command.

<sect>CommServ<label id="CommServ">
<p>


CommServ is a service that allows you to create groups of users for
various purposes - mainly contactability purposes.  Committees control
everything from what commands may be used in services, to what messages
are seen when people sign online.

CommServ is usually the name used for this service, however it may
be called anything the network administrators of your network decide
to call it.  Since CommServ is unique to Magick, there are no other
commonly known names for CommServ.  All commands to MemoServ are done
through private messages, or queries.  This document will assume you
know how to send a private message.


<sect1>Extended Commands<label id="CommServ_Extended_Commands">
<p>


Many of the commands that are available to users (see user.txt) have some
extra features available to members of the privileged committees only.
Some of these extra features may just be the ability to execute a command
on another user's nickname that normally only they could execute on
themselves, however some commands add entirely new functionality.

the value it was locked at,  however the committee head(s) may once
gain change it as required.  You may not override or unlock a global
lock (ie. a value set as locked in the Magick configuration file, that
is active for all committees).

Setting this to RESET will lock the value to whatever newly registered
	committees are set to (ie. the default value).
You must be on the SOP committee to use this command.

HelpServ is a service that fulfills an entirely informational purpose.
This service is also the global noticer (the service used for sending
out messages to all users when necessary).

HelpServ is usually the name used for this service, however it may
be called anything the network administrators of your network decide
to call it.  Common names are HelpServ, HepS and HelpOP.  All
commands to HelpServ are done through private messages, or queries.
This document will assume you know how to send a private message.


<sect1>Extended Commands<label id="HelpServ_Extended_Commands">

Many of the commands that are available to users (see user.txt) have some
extra features available to members of the privileged committees only.
Some of these extra features may just be the ability to execute a command
on another user's nickname that normally only they could execute on
themselves, however some commands add entirely new functionality.

removing users from the network, to disabling parts of services.

OperServ is usually the name used for this service, however it may
be called anything the network administrators of your network decide

Although an IRC operator is technically anyone who can set mode +o on the
network, for the purposes of services, IRC operators are anyone who is
a member of the OPER committee.  Members of the OPER committee are added
by members of the ADMIN committee.  Services may or may not require you
to actually have mode +o set to be recognized as being on the OPER
committee (so not all members of the OPER committee must be IRC
operators).  You may or may not also have to identify to your nickname to
identify to be recognized as being on the OPER committee.

Not all parts of every command listed in this section are available to

</verb>
This maintains the clone override list.  The clone override list is
simply a list of hosts (no nicknames or idents, however wildcards are
allowed), the amount of clones allowed to log on from that host, and why
the override is in place.  The amount of clones allowed must at least be
between 1 and the maximum allowable override amount set in the Magick
configuration file.
<descrip>
<tag/ADD/

This maintains the auto kill list.  The auto kill list is simply a list
of hostmasks (no nicknames, however wildcards are allowed), the time they
should remain killed (from the time of last modification), and why they
have been killed.  The maximum time allowable is different for each
committee, and set in the Magick configuration file.

simply a list of hostmasks (wildcards allowed) that services will not
respond to under any circumstances.  Users who trip flood protection
can be temporarily added to the services ignore list, however only
after tripping the services flood protection several times in a specific
time limit (the amount and time limit are in the Magick configuration

This maintains the IRC operator deny list.  The IRC operator deny list
is simply a list of hostmasks (wildcards allowed) that services will not
allow user to set mode +o (ie. become an IRC operator) from.  If any
user attempts to become an IRC operator from a mask on this list, the
IRC operator status will be stripped by services if the IRC server
supports it, or the user will be killed if it doesn't.
<descrip>
<tag/ADD/

This will manage services High Traffic Mode.  While in High Traffic Mode
various commands will be disabled, mainly ones that incur a large amount
of response messages from services.  The aim of High Traffic Mode is to
temporarily retard services in an effort to reduce bandwidth usage to
until the higher bandwidth usage subsides.  High Traffic Mode will
activate on its own when the average traffic over 5 seconds goes above the
HTM threshold.  Once this happens, the sampling window will increase by
2 seconds (ie. become 7 seconds) at the end of which the average traffic
is measured again.  If the traffic has not subsided by the time the
sampling window has exceeded 60 seconds, services will disconnect.
<descrip>
<tag/ON/
  will force High Traffic Mode on, and set the sampling window to 30
	seconds.  This works exactly the same as if the sampling window
	had gradually risen to 30 seconds.  A global message will be
	sent announcing that High Traffic Mode was forced on.
<tag/OFF/
  will force High Traffic Mode off, and the sampling window will be
	set back to 5 seconds.  A global message will be sent announcing
	that High Traffic Mode was forced off.
<tag/SET/
will change the traffic threshold at which High Traffic Mode will
	activate.  This value should be in Magick's own Space Format

Tracing is an advanced feature of services that allows almost everything
services does to be tracked.  Magick is coded with special trace coding
inside it that allows files to be created with everything from code check
points, comments, data modifications, all the way up to all traffic to

services are setting and removing throughout its execution.  If you don't
know what it does, you probably don't need it, as it is more of a tool to
debug services than for general usage.
