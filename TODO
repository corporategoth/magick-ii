Feature requests that have been 'approved' by the
development team to be worked on, and are coming:

- Expanded flood protection (eg. nick flood = kill, etc)

- Optional secure server list (auto squit if not listed)

- Per-channel clone override lists (kick if cloning)

- Re-add the 'CS Override' level system (where you can
  config what level you need for various overrides).

- Change .lfo and .lng files (in language directory) to
  accept something like $1, $2, etc and replace with the
  string equivilant of arg1, arg2, etc.  This way we can
  move around arguments for languages that have different
  sentance structures.

- Add the rest of the trace code, and implement the other
  trace types (and use them).

- Add comments to code base, such standards as what the
  function does, peculiarities about it, and other
  commenting that tell you how the program works or the
  bit of code in question fits into the grand scheme.

- Performance tuning, as parts of the code work, but are
  horribly slow or convoluted (as with any big project!)

- See where else I can use the MemCluster class to stop
  rapid new/deletes (or mallocs/frees).

- Support IRC3 (http://www.dragonfire.net/~achurch/irc3)
  protocol.  This will probably wait until there it is
  finalised, and there is actually a server using it.

This is by no means an extensive list, there are alot more
suggestions being tracked in the docs/develop directory.
