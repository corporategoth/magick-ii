Feature requests that have been 'approved' by the
development team to be worked on, and are coming:


- SECUREOPER - ie. you cannot set mode +o unless you are on
  this committee.  If the committee (or nickname) is secure,
  then this will effectively make the user ident before /oper.

- Expanded flood protection (eg. nick flood = kill, etc)

- Auto-AKILL if clone protection is triggered > x times
  for one host (x should be config file based)

- Optional secure server list (auto squit if not listed)

- Per-channel clone override lists (kick if cloning)

- Change .lfo and .lng files (in language directory) to
  accept something like $1, $2, etc and replace with the
  string equivilant of arg1, arg2, etc.  This way we can
  move around arguments for languages that have different
  sentance structures.

This is by no means an extensive list, there are alot more
suggestions being tracked in the docs/develop directory.
