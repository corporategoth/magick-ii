Feature requests that have been 'approved' by the
development team to be worked on, and are coming:

- Expanded flood protection (eg. nick flood = kill, etc)

- Optional secure server list (auto squit if not listed)

- Per-channel clone override lists (kick if cloning)

- Change .lfo and .lng files (in language directory) to
  accept something like $1, $2, etc and replace with the
  string equivilant of arg1, arg2, etc.  This way we can
  move around arguments for languages that have different
  sentance structures.

This is by no means an extensive list, there are alot more
suggestions being tracked in the docs/develop directory.
