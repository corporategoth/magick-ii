Feature requests that have been 'approved' by the
development team to be worked on, and are coming:

- Expanded flood protection (eg. nick flood = kill, etc)

- Per-channel clone override lists (kick if cloning)

- Move storage of memos and news articles into the
  nick and channel stored records respectively.

- Add new AKILL funcitons for 3 new types:
    * Nickname matchine mask
    * Being in a channel matching mask
    * Having a realname matching mask
  Each case it should add the default ignore host to the
  regular akill list -- however the default akill list
  command should not show them unless 'all' is specified.
  Alternately could maintain different lists for each.

- Add functionality (while services are up only) to
  'reserve' a nickname (ie. services keep it and dont
  sign off of it, but its not going to reply to anything).
  And of course, ability to un-reserve it (kill?)

- Add the rest of the trace code, and implement the other
  trace types (and use them).

- Add comments to code base, such standards as what the
  function does, peculiarities about it, and other
  commenting that tell you how the program works or the
  bit of code in question fits into the grand scheme.
  Should use doxygen style (obtainable from:
  http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen) so that the
  code is auto-documented for us, and nicely laid out.

- Performance tuning, as parts of the code work, but are
  horribly slow or convoluted (as with any big project!)

- Support IRC3 (http://www.dragonfire.net/~achurch/irc3)
  protocol.  This will probably wait until there it is
  finalised, and there is actually a server using it.

This is by no means an extensive list, there are alot more
suggestions being tracked in the docs/develop directory.
