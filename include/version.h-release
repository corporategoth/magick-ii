** $Log$
** Revision 1.11  2000/03/25 04:26:48  prez

** Fixed the Magick Help System (needed to add to ExtractWord).
** Also replaced #pragma ident's with static const char *ident's
** that will be picked up by what or version, and we can now
** dump from a binary what versions of each file were used.
**
** Revision 1.8  2000/02/15 10:37:47  prez
** Added standardized headers to ALL Magick source files, including

/* Versioning Information
 *
 * The PRODUCT and VERSION should only ever be changed
 * by the Magick Development Team.  PLEASE do not change
 * this because you think it'd be funky to have 'MyNet
 * services', we DO diserve SOME creditation for what
 * we've done, dont you think?  The PRODUCT text may
 * only be ONE word (else it stuffs up version replies).
 *
 * For a FULL release product (non-alpha/beta), the
 * RELEASE value will be blank (else it will contain
 * either aN or bN (where n is the alpha or beta number
 * respectively).  It may also contain pre for pre-
 * release code.
 *
 * Up to 9 patch levels are allowed for, so if you write
 * a patch for magick that has to alter the actual code,
 * add your patch name to one of the patch levels.  Nine
 * are provided because often multipal patches are used
 * for various reasons, but if you need more than nine
 * patches on the original source, you should re-think.
