** Revision 1.30  2001/05/06 03:03:07  prez
** Changed all language sends to use $ style tokens too (aswell as logs), so we're
** now standard.  most ::send calls are now SEND and NSEND.  ::announce has also
** been changed to ANNOUNCE and NANNOUNCE.  All language files modified already.
** Also added example lng and lfo file, so you can see the context of each line.

"; This file is split up into sections.  These sections are so",
"; that we can logically group responses together.  IF you change",
"; the section names, or the response 'tags' within them, then",
"; you will likely break Magick's responses.  IF you are a",
"; developer and adding new sections, please note that they may",
"; NOT have a '/' (forward-slash) or space in their name.",
";",
"; Throughout this file there are various codes used for various",
"; purposes, from making it look prettier on IRC, to replacing",
"; the codes with a value direct from Magick.  There are three",
"; tables listed below which outline the codes and their meanings.",
"; All lines in this file starting with ';' are comments.  If your",
"; response string has leading spaces, you MUST put a '\\' in front",
"; of the first space, else leading spaces are stripped.",
";",
"; In each string there are (or can be) $ replacement tokens,",
"; where the number after the $ is the paramater to replace",
"; with.  You may re-order the paramaters passed (or remove",
"; them alltogether) by simply changing around these tokens.",
"; Starting a token number with 0 will treat all following",
"; numbers literally (useful to follow a token with a number).",
"; eg. $1$0123 will output whatever is in $1, then 123 (the",
"; $0 is ignored).  You cannot change the format of a token.",
";",
"; The IRC beautifying codes are generally accepted codes that",
"; have certain functions on ALL IRC clients.  The codes listed",
"; are all 'control' codes, meaning you hold control then push",
"; the key listed to insert the code.",
";",
"; The mIRC colour codes are here for convenience, but it is NOT",
"; recommended you use them, as there are a lot of IRC clients",
"; (especially UNIX based) that will not be able to understand",
"; them and make the output unreadable.  When using these codes,",
"; to change just the foreground you use ^C# where # is the colour",
"; code.  For foreground and background, you use ^C#,#.  To reset",
"; the text back to 'no colour' you just use ^C.",
";",
