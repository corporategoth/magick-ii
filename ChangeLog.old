Magick I (Preston Elder <prez@magick.tm>)
--------

Renamed to this to avoid conflicting version numbers, etc and finally
rid myself of all the excess EsperNet baggage.

1999/02/20 .4	Added copyrights back from espernet, so they would stop
		    bitching at me for removing them (even though I DID
		    modify the code to an extent they no longer resemble
		    their services).  *shrug* some people.
		Added configuration file (see DOC dir) (Ungod)
		Added messages.h to customize Magick output.
		Added SYNC_TIME (dbase save) showing option
		Made MODE strings (User, Channel, ChanInfo) DYNAMIC
		Fixed AutoUpdate on databases
		Fixed fuckloads more bugs (as usual).

		Added LIVE (non-fork) mode (CTRL-C forks).
		Added MS REPLY, NS ACCESS CURRENT and NS SLAVES functions.
1998/01/20 .3	Added MLOCK +i and +k support (ChanServ will keep channel if
		    noone in it!).
		doc/Distribution -- READ it (and all files in that DIR!) :)
		Removed time_zone and added the "X time ago" formats
		Fixed lots and lots of bugs, and optimized alot of code!

		Replaced old IGNORE with Flood Protect (smarter system!)
		Theres lots more little additions, but too many to document.
1997/12/30 .2	Added new revenge level (REVERSE, now NONE will do NOTHING).
		Fixed a few minor bugs (with unsuspension, breakdown
		    percentages, and handling nick collides, etc).
		Moved Services OP list to a access list-style format.
		Removed the SUPER_PASSWORD - now only the SERVICES_ADMINS
		    (hardcoded in config.h) can do that :)
		Added removing by number to ALL lists now :)
		Added OperServ MASKLIST (like USERLIST but accepts user@host).
		Removed the magick.msg and magick.omsg in favour of the new
		    OperServ LOGONMSG and OPERMSG commands :)
		Wrote both user and oper documentation for ALL commands!
1997/12/15 .1	Optimized code and implemented hash tables (if you dont know,
		    dont worry - just take it as a good thing!).
		Added some of Andy Church's services routines (overflow stuff,
		    some socket stuff, and the configure script mainly).
		Removed upaccess - people should have used it, or not need it.
		Added MemoServ OPERSEND.
		Fixed user/oper counting when SQUIT.
		Fixed ghost command and Channel/Nick expiry bugs.
		Added Users on Servers breakdown (OperServ)
		OFF/ON commands now close/open logs aswell.
1997/12/08 .0	Forgot the new services.h for Services 3.0.9, included here.
		Veriable ChanServ levels implemented (finally).

		    a user's channels when a user is deleted.
		Moved names for services to config.h
		Magick know more about their own actions (dont laugh!)
		IrcOP's dont trigger clone protection (are ignored).
		Added ability to use PRIVMSG instead of NOTICE.
		Added ChanServ JOIN ability (some like it - I dont).

		AKILL and CLONE may now be removed by number.
