;
; --------------------------------------------------------------
;
; This file is split up into sections.  These sections are so
; that we can logically group responses together.  IF you change
; the section names, or the response 'tags' within them, then
; you will likely break Magick's responses.  IF you are a
; developer and adding new sections, please note that they may
; NOT have a '/' (forward-slash) or space in their name.
;
; Throughout this file there are various codes used for various
; purposes, from making it look prettier on IRC, to replacing
; the codes with a value direct from Magick.  There are three
; tables listed below which outline the codes and their meanings.
; All lines in this file starting with ';' are comments.  If your
; response string has leading spaces, you MUST put a '\' in front
; of the first space, else leading spaces are stripped.
;
; In each string there are (or can be) $ replacement tokens,
; where the number after the $ is the paramater to replace
; with.  You may re-order the paramaters passed (or remove
; them alltogether) by simply changing around these tokens.
; Starting a token number with 0 will treat all following
; numbers literally (useful to follow a token with a number).
; eg. $1$0123 will output whatever is in $1, then 123 (the
; $0 is ignored).  You cannot change the format of a token.
;
; The IRC beautifying codes are generally accepted codes that
; have certain functions on ALL IRC clients.  The codes listed
; are all 'control' codes, meaning you hold control then push
; the key listed to insert the code.
;
; The mIRC colour codes are here for convenience, but it is NOT
; recommended you use them, as there are a lot of IRC clients
; (especially UNIX based) that will not be able to understand
; them and make the output unreadable.  When using these codes,
; to change just the foreground you use ^C# where # is the colour
; code.  For foreground and background, you use ^C#,#.  To reset
; the text back to 'no colour' you just use ^C.
;
; --------------------------------------------------------------
;
; IRC beautifying codes:
;   ^B () = BOLD       - Make text between look brighter
;   ^_ () = UNDERLINE  - Underline text between
;   ^V () = REVERSE    - Switch foreground and background
;   ^O () = CANCEL     - Back to non-bold/underline/reverse
;   ^C () = COLOUR     - See below
;
; mIRC colour codes:
;   0 = White           8  = Yellow
;   1 = Black           9  = Bright Green
;   2 = Blue            10 = Cyan
;   3 = Green           11 = Bright Cyan
;   4 = Red             12 = Bright Blue
;   5 = Orange          13 = Bright Magenta
;   6 = Magenta         14 = Grey
;   7 = Bright Red      15 = Bright Grey
