;
; This file is divided up into sections, each section being
; a command that can be executed in Magick.  The section name
; simply replaces spaces with a '/' character, and puts the
; name of the service in front (NOT the nickname, but the
; GetInternalName() value).
;
; Each entry in a section will be sorted by the tag, so please
; ensure that ALL tags are in order -- the actual name of the
; tags does not matter, however PLEASE ENSURE THE TAG IS IN
; UPPER CASE!  The detection engine is CASE SENSITIVE.
;
; Each entry has 3 fields, separated by a colon (':'):
;    1. Committees to display for.
;       If specified, the user must be on ANY committees you
;       specify in this field, committees are separated by a
;       space.  If not specified, it will assume 'ALL'.
;    2. Committees not to display for.
;       If specified, the user may not be on ANY of the
;       committees you specify in this field, committees are
;       separated by a space.  If not specify it will assume
;       none (ie. do not deny anyone).
;    3. The actual text of the help entry, which will be
;       displayed to the user verbatim.  If this field is
;       left blank, a blank line will be sent to the user.
;       This field MAY contain colons (':'), they will be
;       treated like any other character.
;
; It is usually not a good idea to output anything more than
; about 15-20 lines to a user unless absolutely necessary.  You
; should be descriptive about what the command does, and how
; to use it.

[NICKSERV]
01 =::This service allows you to register your nickname
02 =::so that it may not be taken by anyone else.
03 =::
04 =::This service allows you to use the following commands:
05 =::    HELP         REGISTER     LINK         IDENTIFY
06 =::    INFO         GHOST        RECOVER      LIST
07 =REGD::    DROP         UNLINK       HOST         SLAVES
08 =REGD::    ACCESS       IGNORE       SET          SEND
09 =SOP::And as a Services Operator, the following commands:
10 =SOP::    SETPASS      LOCK         UNLOCK       FORBID
11 =SOP:SADMIN:    SUSPEND      UNSUSPEND    LIVE
11 =SADMIN::    GETPASS      SUSPEND      UNSUSPEND    LIVE
12 =::
13 =::You may request help on the syntax and functionality
14 =::of any and all of the above commands by specifying
15 =::the command name after the HELP request.
16 =::NOTE: Only commands you currently may use are listed
17 =::      above, and things such as nickname registration
18 =::      may change what is displayed above.

[NICKSERV/REGISTER]
01 =::REGISTER <password> [email]
02 =::
03 =::This will make your nickname recognised with services.
04 =::By doing so, services will reserve your nickname for
05 =::just you, and will kill or rename any user who tries to
06 =::use it and does not come from your regular address (as
07 =::long as Kill Protection is set).  Once registered, you
08 =::can use the IDENTIFY command to be recognised from
09 =::somewhere other than your regular address, or if you have
10 =::more than one address, you can add it to the ACCESS list.
11 =::
12 =::Nickname registration is required to be added to any
13 =::channel access list, or to send a memo to another user.
14 =::Please choose a password you will remember, but that is
15 =::suitably complex when registering your nickname.  If
16 =::someone else gets your password, they can then exercise
17 =::total control over your nickname, including forbidding
18 =::you access to it.  If you have lost your password, you
19 =::can contact a Services Operator to retrieve it for you.
20 =::
21 =::Your email address is optional, and may be changed with
22 =::the SET EMAIL command.  It is recommended you set an
23 =::email address with services as it makes retrieving your
24 =::much more secure (as operators can then email it to you).

[NICKSERV/DROP]
01 =REGD::DROP [nickname]
02 =REGD::
03 =REGD::This will de-register your nickname.  Doing so will
04 =REGD::remove you from all channel access lists you are on,
05 =REGD::force all channels you are founder of to be given to
06 =REGD::the co-founder or be droped if there is none, remove
07 =REGD::all your memos (read or unread), and if done on a host
08 =REGD::nickname, drop all slaves of it.
09 =REGD::
10A=REGD:SOP:If you specify a nickname after the drop command, and
11A=REGD:SOP:the nickname is linked to you, it will drop it, if not,
12A=REGD:SOP:it will drop your current nickname.
10B=SOP::If you specify a nickname after the drop command, it
11B=SOP::will drop that nickname (weather you own it or not).
12B=SOP::Otherwise it will drop your current nickname.

[NICKSERV/LINK]
01 =::LINK <nickname> <password>
02 =::
03 =::This will link your current nickname to another, making
04 =::it your host nickname.  From that point, both nicknames
05 =::will be considered equivalent, they will share access
06 =::lists (both nickname and channel), if one is added to a
07 =::committee they will all be members of it, they will
08 =::share the same memo list, etc.
09 =::
10 =::IMPORTANT: IF YOUR CURRENT NICKNAME IS REGISTERED,
11 =::IT WILL BE DROPPED BEFORE BEING LINKED TO YOUR HOST.

[NICKSERV/UNLINK]
01 =REGD::UNLINK [nick]
02 =REGD::
03 =REGD::This will unlink your nick from your host nick, first
04 =REGD::duplicating all settings, the access and ignore lists.
05 =REGD::Any modifications made to your nickname after this
06 =REGD::command is executed will NOT be reciprocated on the
07 =REGD::host nickname.  You will also be removing yourself
08 =REGD::from all access lists that the host nickname is on.
09 =REGD::
10 =REGD::If a nickname is specified after the unlink command,
11 =REGD::and it is linked to you, it will be unlinked instead.

[NICKSERV/HOST]
01 =REGD::HOST [nickname]
02 =REGD::
03 =REGD::This will change your host nickname to your current
04 =REGD::nickname, or the nickname specified after the host
05 =REGD::command if it is linked to you.  Doing so will not
06 =REGD::change anything regarding your access to channels,
07 =REGD::memos, or committee membership, however you will
08 =REGD::show up as the new host nickname as founder of any
09 =REGD::channels you own, and on all access lists you are on.

[NICKSERV/SLAVES]
01A=REGD:OPER:SLAVES
01B=OPER::SLAVES [nick]
02 =REGD::
03 =REGD::This will list out all of your linked nicknames.
04 =OPER::If you specify a nickname, it will list theirs instead.
05 =REGD::
06 =REGD::Slave nicknames are created with the LINK command.

[NICKSERV/IDENTIFY]
01 =::IDENTIFY <password>
02 =::
03 =::This will identify you to your nickname.  This is
04 =::required if you have Kill Protection on, and try to
05 =::use your nickname from a host that is not in your
06 =::access list, or wish to change your password.  It
07 =::is also required to use your nick at all (regardless
08 =::of your access list) if you have Secure on.  It is
09 =::also required if you wish to make use of your access
10 =::on any channels or committees that have Secure on.
11 =::
12 =::The password you specify should be the same as the
13 =::one you set with the REGISTER or SET PASSWORD command.

[NICKSERV/INFO]
01 =::INFO <nickname>
02 =::
03 =::This will give you various information about a given
04 =::nickname.  This includes information such as their
05 =::e-mail address, web address, ICQ UIN, and physical
06 =::description if they have set them, the time they were
07 =::last online and where they came from (If they do not
08 =::have the Private option set on).  It will also tell
09 =::you what options they have set, what committees they
10 =::are on, and weather they have a downloadable picture.
11 =OPER::
12 =OPER::As an oper, you may also see a comment about that
13 =OPER::user, which has been set by a SOP either as a prior
14 =OPER::suspend reason, or manually.  Please be advised that
15 =OPER::normal users CANNOT see this field.

[NICKSERV/GHOST]
01 =::GHOST <nickname> <password>
02 =::
03 =::This will kill a user (or service) that is holding
04 =::your nickname from the network.  This is used to
05 =::regain your nickname after you have timed out, and
06 =::your nickname has not, or you have failed to identify
07 =::in time, and services have taken your nickname.
08 =::
09 =::The password you specify should be the same as the
10 =::one you set with the REGISTER or SET PASSWORD command.

[NICKSERV/RECOVER]
01 =::RECOVER <nickname> <password>
02 =::
03 =::This will kill a user that is using your nickname
04 =::and services will take it themselves.  If you do not
05 =::have Kill Protection on, or your access list happens
06 =::to cover another user as well as yourself, it is
07 =::possible they could use your nickname without being
08 =::challenged and renamed/killed for doing so.  It is
09 =::recommended you set Secure on if this is the case.
10 =::To get rid of services using your nickname, you must
11 =::use the GHOST command.
12 =::
13 =::The password you specify should be the same as the
14 =::one you set with the REGISTER or SET PASSWORD command.

[NICKSERV/LIST]
01 =::LIST [mask [maximum]]
02 =SOP::LISTNOEXP [mask [maximum]]
03 =SOP::LISTFORBID [mask [maximum]]
04 =SOP::LISTSUSP [mask [maximum]]
05 =::
06 =::This will list all registered nicknames that match
07 =::the mask you have specified and their last hosts or
08 =::"ONLINE" up to a default maximum number of entries
09 =::set by the Services Admins.  You override the maximum
10 =::amount of entries displayed up to an absolute maximum
11 =::also specified by the Services Admins.  Users marked
12A=:OPER:as private will not be displayed in the list.
12B=OPER::as private will be displayed in the list.
13 =SOP::The NOEXP, FORBID and SUSP suffixes to the LIST command
14 =SOP::will list only people with No Expire set, Forbidden
15 =SOP::users, or suspended users respectively.

[NICKSERV/SEND]
01 =REGD::SEND <nickname>
02 =REGD::
03 =REGD::If the nickname specified has a picture in their
04 =REGD::nickserv record, this command will allow you to
05 =REGD::download it.  Services will start a DCC file
06 =REGD::transfer with you of that file, named as the
07 =REGD::users nickname, and the file extension.

[NICKSERV/SUSPEND]
01 =SOP::SUSPEND <nickname> <reason>
02 =SOP::
03 =SOP::This will stop a user from being able to identify to
04 =SOP::their nickname, however it will NOT stop them from
05 =SOP::using it unless they have Secure on.  Because they
06 =SOP::cannot ident, they also cannot drop their nick, or
07 =SOP::change their password.  This is meant to be a short
08 =SOP::term disciplinary measure while a complaint is under
09 =SOP::review against this user, or to caution them rather
10 =SOP::than just dropping or akilling them from the network.

[NICKSERV/UNSUSPEND]
01 =SOP::UNSUSPEND <nickname>
02 =SOP::
03 =SOP::This will essentially reverse the suspend command,
04 =SOP::allowing the user to use their nickname as normal.
05 =SOP::The suspend reason will however remain as a comment
06 =SOP::on the users nickname record, to remove this you
07 =SOP::must use the SET COMMENT command.

[NICKSERV/FORBID]
01 =SOP::FORBID <nickname>
02 =SOP::
03 =SOP::This will forbid a nickname from being used on the
04 =SOP::network, and will force any user who attempts to use
05 =SOP::it to change their nick or be killed/renamed.

[NICKSERV/GETPASS]
01 =SADMIN::GETPASS <nickname>
02 =SADMIN::
03 =SADMIN::This will retrieve the nickname password for a user.
04 =SADMIN::Please note that whenever this command is used, a
05 =SADMIN::global message to all IRCOPS will be broadcast!
06 =SADMIN::NOTE: This feature may or may not be available.

[NICKSERV/SETPASS]
01 =SOP::SETPASS <nickname> <password>
02 =SOP::
03 =SOP::This will reset the nickname password for a user.
04 =SOP::Please note that whenever this command is used, a
05 =SOP::global message to all IRCOPS will be broadcast!
06 =SOP:SADMIN:You may not reset the password of a Services
07 =SOP:SADMIN:Administrator.

[NICKSERV/LIVE]
01 =SOP::LIVE [mask [maximum]]
02 =SOP::LIVEOPER [mask [maximum]]
03 =SOP::
04 =SOP::This will list all online nicknames that match the
05 =SOP::full nick!user@host mask specified.  If the nick is
06 =SOP::left off, * will be assumed.  If the host is left
07 =SOP::off, *@* will be assumed.  This will display the
08 =SOP::users full host, what server they are on, and what
09 =SOP::modes they currently have set.  The OPER suffix to
10 =SOP::the LIST command will list only people with mode
11 =SOP::+o set (ie. IRC Operators).

[NICKSERV/ACCESS]
01 =REGD::Your access list is a method to be able to come in
02 =REGD::from more than one hostmask, without having to
03 =REGD::re-identify yourself every time you log on.  Unless
04 =REGD::you have Secure on, you will be recognised without
05 =REGD::identifying when coming from any of the hosts in your
06 =REGD::access list.
07 =REGD::
08 =REGD::You maintain your access list with these commands:
09 =REGD::    CURRENT      ADD          DEL          LIST

[NICKSERV/ACCESS/CURRENT]
01 =REGD::ACCESS CURRENT
02 =REGD::
03 =REGD::This will add your current hostmask (*user@*.host) to
04 =REGD::your access list.  This is just a shortcut to typing
05 =REGD::out the full add command.

[NICKSERV/ACCESS/ADD]
01 =REGD::ACCESS ADD <mask>
02 =REGD::
03 =REGD::This will add the hostmask you specify to your access
04 =REGD::list.  You may use wildcards in your hostmask (ie. *
05 =REGD::and ? characters). You must include a '@' character
06 =REGD::in your hostmask, and may not include a '!' character.
07 =REGD::
08 =REGD::A typical entry would be *myident@*.myisp.com

[NICKSERV/ACCESS/DEL]
01 =REGD::ACCESS DEL <mask|NUM>
02 =REGD::
03 =REGD::This will remove a hostmask (or more than one) from
04 =REGD::your access list.  If you specify a number, then it
05 =REGD::will be assumed to be an entry number that corresponds
06 =REGD::to the numbers printed with the ACCESS LIST command.
07 =REGD::Otherwise it will delete all hostmasks matching the
08 =REGD::mask you specify (which may be multiple entries).

[NICKSERV/ACCESS/LIST]
01 =REGD::ACCESS LIST
02 =REGD::
03 =REGD::This will list out the contents of your access list,
04 =REGD::and give each entry an index number that can be used
05 =REGD::with the DEL command to quickly delete an entry.

[NICKSERV/IGNORE]
01 =REGD::Your ignore list will block any memos that are sent
02 =REGD::you by all nicknames on it.  If you do not wish to
03 =REGD::associate with a person anymore, and they keep sending
04 =REGD::you memos, or you are getting memo bombed, then just
05 =REGD::add the offending nickname to your ignore list.
06 =REGD::
07 =REGD::When used in conjunction with the No Memo option, it
08 =REGD::will reverse the functionality of this list.  It will
09 =REGD::become a list of people to ACCEPT memos from.
10 =REGD::
11 =REGD::You maintain your ignore list with these commands:
12 =REGD::    ADD          DEL          LIST

[NICKSERV/IGNORE/ADD]
01 =REGD::IGNORE ADD <nickname>
02 =REGD::
03 =REGD::This will add a nickname to your ignore list, and
04 =REGD::you will no longer accept memos from them (or you
05 =REGD::WILL start accepting memos from them if the No Memo
06 =REGD::option is set on).  You may only specify a registered
07 =REGD::nickname.

[NICKSERV/IGNORE/DEL]
01 =REGD::IGNORE DEL <nick|NUM>
02 =REGD::
03 =REGD::This will remove a nickname from your memo ignore
04 =REGD::list, and you will one again accept or deny memos
05 =REGD::from them, depending on your No Memo setting.  If
06 =REGD::a number is specified, it will be assumed to be an
07 =REGD::entry number that corresponds to the numbers printed
08 =REGD::with the IGNORE LIST command.

[NICKSERV/IGNORE/LIST]
01 =REGD::IGNORE LIST
02 =REGD::
03 =REGD::This will list out the contents of your ignore list,
04 =REGD::and give each entry an index number that can be used
05 =REGD::with the DEL command to quickly delete an entry.

[NICKSERV/SET]
01 =REGD::Services maintains many settings on your nick
02 =REGD::record, ranging from your password, to an e-mail
03 =REGD::address you specify, to options that effect how
04 =REGD::services treat your nickname.  Some of these you
05 =REGD::must identify to set, others being recognised is
06 =REGD::enough (which is the same thing if Secure is set).
07 =REGD::
08 =REGD::You may alter your settings with these commands:
09 =REGD::    PASSWORD     EMAIL        URL          ICQ
10 =REGD::    DESCRIPTION  PICTURE      PROTECT      SECURE
11 =REGD::    NOMEMO       PRIVATE      PRIVMSG      LANGUAGE
12 =SOP::As a SOP you may also use the following commands:
13 =SOP::    COMMENT      NOEXPIRE

[NICKSERV/SET/PASSWORD]
01 =REGD::SET PASSWORD <password>
02 =REGD::
03 =REGD::This will change your nickname password.  This
04 =REGD::password is required for the IDENTIFY command (ie.
05 =REGD::to use your nickname from somewhere not on your
06 =REGD::access list).  It is also required for the GHOST
07 =REGD::and RECOVER commands.  If you have secure set on,
08 =REGD::this password is need to USE your nickname.  You
09 =REGD::must identify before you may use this command.
10 =REGD::
11 =REGD::Please choose a password you will remember, but that is
12 =REGD::suitably complex when registering your nickname.  If
14 =REGD::someone else gets your nickname password, they can then
15 =REGD::exercise total control over it, including forbidding you
16 =REGD::access to it.  If you have lost your password, you can
17 =REGD::contact a Services Operator to retrieve it for you.

[NICKSERV/SET/EMAIL]
01 =REGD::SET EMAIL <email>
02 =REGD::
03 =REGD::This is a field provided to represent your e-mail
04 =REGD::address.  Right now, it is a free-text field, however
05 =REGD::it is recommended you ensure the data you put in this
06 =REGD::is a valid email address, as it may be used later for
07 =REGD::such things as network announcements, etc.
08 =REGD::
09 =REGD::This value will display as-is in your INFO display.
10 =REGD::Setting this value to "NONE" will clear it.

[NICKSERV/SET/URL]
01 =REGD::SET URL <url>
02 =REGD::
03 =REGD::This is a field provided to represent your web page
04 =REGD::address.  Right now, it is a free-text field, however
05 =REGD::it is recommended you ensure the data you put in this
06 =REGD::is a valid web page address, as it may be used later
07 =REGD::for such things as users links page, etc.  You do not
08 =REGD::need to (and should not) put 'http://' in the url.
09 =REGD::
10 =REGD::This value will display as-is in your INFO display.
11 =REGD::Setting this value to "NONE" will clear it.

[NICKSERV/SET/ICQ]
01 =REGD::SET ICQ <uin>
02 =REGD::
03 =REGD::This is a field provided to represent your ICQ UIN.
04 =REGD::Right now, it is a free-text field, however it is
05 =REGD::recommended you ensure the data you put in this is
06 =REGD::a valid ICQ UIN, as it may be used later for such
07 =REGD::things as current users status, etc.
08 =REGD::
09 =REGD::This value will display as-is in your INFO display.
10 =REGD::Setting this value to "NONE" will clear it.

[NICKSERV/SET/DESCRIPTION]
01 =REGD::SET DESCRIPTION <description>
02 =REGD::
03 =REGD::This field is provided to provide others with a
04 =REGD::physical description of yourself, or stats about
05 =REGD::yourself (age, sex, location, etc).  Please also
06 =REGD::see help on the SET PICTURE command if you have
07 =REGD::picture of yourself you don't mind sharing around.
08 =REGD::
09 =REGD::This value will display as-is in your INFO display.
10 =REGD::Setting this value to "NONE" will clear it.

[NICKSERV/SET/COMMENT]
01 =SOP::SET COMMENT <nickname> <comment>
02 =SOP::
03 =SOP::This will set (or clear) a comment on a users INFO
04 =SOP::record.  Normal users will not be able to see this
05 =SOP::comment, however all members of the OPER committee
06 =SOP::will.  When a user is suspended, the suspend reason
07 =SOP::is set as the comment automatically, and this will
08 =SOP::remain even after the user is unsuspended.
09 =SOP::
10 =SOP::Setting this value to "NONE" will clear it.

[NICKSERV/SET/PICTURE]
01 =REGD::SET PICTURE [NONE]
02 =REGD::
03 =REGD::This will setup services to receive a DCC file
04 =REGD::from you, which will be set as your picture.
05 =REGD::Both the file extension, and file size may be
06 =REGD::restricted, to find out what extensions you
07 =REGD::may send, or the maximum file size, please
08 =REGD::contact any IRC Operator.
09 =REGD::
10 =REGD::Once the DCC completes, any user may download
11 =REGD::your picture with the SEND command.  If you
12 =REGD::specify "NONE" after the SET PICTURE command,
13 =REGD::your picture will be removed from your record.

[NICKSERV/SET/PROTECT]
01 =REGD::SET PROTECT <ON|OFF>
02 =REGD::
03 =REGD::This will turn on or off Kill Protection.
04 =REGD::When this option is on, if anyone attempts to use
05 =REGD::your nickname from a hostmask not in your access
06 =REGD::list, they will be asked to identify, or be renamed
07 =REGD::or killed.

[NICKSERV/SET/SECURE]
01 =REGD::SET SECURE <ON|OFF>
02 =REGD::
03 =REGD::This will turn on or off Secure.
04 =REGD::When this option is on, you must use the identify
05 =REGD::command to be recognised (essentially turning on
06 =REGD::paranoia mode, disregarding your access list).  It
07 =REGD::will also mean you need to ident to get any access
08 =REGD::on any channel you join, to read your memos, etc.

[NICKSERV/SET/NOEXPIRE]
01 =SOP::SET NOEXPIRE <nickname> <ON|OFF>
02 =SOP::
03 =SOP::When you set this on a nickname, that nickname will
04 =SOP::not be subject to nickname expiration if it is not
05 =SOP::used after a period of time.  Please use this very
06 =SOP::cautiously, as nickname expiration guarantees that
07 =SOP::nicknames don't get held up if they're not being used.

[NICKSERV/SET/NOMEMO]
01 =REGD::SET NOMEMO <ON|OFF>
02 =REGD::
03 =REGD::This will turn on or off No Memos.
04 =REGD::When this option is on, you will automatically

07 =REGD::will still accept memos from people on that list.

[NICKSERV/SET/PRIVATE]
01 =REGD::SET PRIVATE <ON|OFF>

13 =REGD::may be added to a channel access list.
14 =REGD::Please choose a password you will remember, but that is
15 =REGD::suitably complex when registering your channel.  If

17 =REGD::total control over your channel, including forbidding
18 =REGD::you access to it.  If you have lost your password, you
19 =REGD::can contact a Services Operator to retrieve it for you.

[CHANSERV/DROP]
01 =REGD::DROP <channel>
02 =REGD::
03 =REGD::This will de-register your channel.  This action is
04 =REGD::permanent, and not reversible.  The channel will once
05 =REGD::be governed by whoever has ops, and nothing will stop

[CHANSERV/SUSPEND]

07 =SOP::access privileges.  All IRC Operators will receive
08 =SOP::Auto Voice, SOPs will receive Auto Ops, and SADMINS
09 =SOP::will receive founder privileges. Because they
10 =SOP::cannot ident, they also cannot drop the channel, or
11 =SOP::change its password.  This is meant to be a short
12 =SOP::term disciplinary measure while a complaint is under
13 =SOP::review against this channel, or to caution the
14 =SOP::channel rather than just dropping it.

[CHANSERV/UNSUSPEND]
01 =SOP::UNSUSPEND <channel>
02 =SOP::
03 =SOP::This will essentially reverse the suspend command,
04 =SOP::allowing the channel access list to resume as normal.

07 =SOP::the SET COMMENT command.

[CHANSERV/FORBID]

06 =::    PreZ!prez@castle.srealm.net.au   or
07 =::    prez@castle.srealm.net.au
08 =::
09 =::Many places (such as access lists) in services require you
10 =::to input a hostmask (they will warn you if you've entered
11 =::the wrong type of hostmask).  In all places where you may
12 =::enter hostmasks, you may also use wildcards.  Wildcards
13 =::are a method of saying 'any character or characters'.

[OPERSERV/TRACE]
01 =SADMIN::Services support 'Tracing', ie. a method of finding
02 =SADMIN::out exactly what the underlying code is doing at any
03 =SADMIN::given time.  This is used for finding bugs easily,
04 =SAMDIN::so they can be fixed faster.  When a trace is on, it

[OPERSERV/TRACE/UP]
01 =SADMIN::TRACE UP <type> <level|name [name [...]]>
02 =SADMIN::
03 =SADMIN::This will 'turn up' the trace level or names you
04 =SADMIN::specify for type.  This is a relative operation, ie.
05 =SADMIN::it will work from the current trace level, and all
06 =SADMIN::previous traces will remain set.  Once a trace level

08 =SADMIN::go into the trace files on the services host.
09 =SADMIN::Please see help on TRACE TYPES and TRACE LEVELS for
10 =SADMIN::available parameters.

[OPERSERV/TRACE/DOWN]
01 =SADMIN::TRACE DOWN <type> <level|name [name [...]]>
02 =SADMIN::
03 =SADMIN::This will 'turn down' the trace level or names you
04 =SADMIN::specify for type.  This is a relative operation, ie.
05 =SADMIN::it will work from the current trace level, and all
06 =SADMIN::previous traces will remain set.  Once a trace level

10 =SADMIN::available parameters.

[OPERSERV/TRACE/SET]
01 =SADMIN::TRACE SET <type> <level|name [name [...]]>
02 =SADMIN::
03 =SADMIN::This will set the trace level or names you specify
04 =SADMIN::as the trace level for type.  This is an absolute
05 =SADMIN::operation, ie. it will clear the trace level before
06 =SADMIN::setting the specified level.  Once a trace level is
07 =SADMIN::set, all output for that trace level will go into
08 =SADMIN::trace files on the services host.

02 =OPER SOP::
03 =OPER SOP::This will display the current modes (including keys
04 =OPER SOP::and limits where applicable) that are set on a nick
05 =OPER SOP::channel.  If modes are specified after the nick or
06 =OPER SOP::channel, it will also attempt to set them.  You may
07A=OPER:SOP:not set modes on a nickname.
07B=SOP::set modes on a nickname as long as the IRC network
08B=SOP::supports it (Please check with an IRC Admin).

[OPERSERV/QLINE]
01 =ADMIN::QLINE <mask> [reason]
02 =ADMIN::
03 =ADMIN::This will attempt to quarantine a nickname from being
04 =ADMIN::used on the network, as long as the IRC network
05 =ADMIN::supports it.  This is equivalent to setting a Q:line
06 =ADMIN::on that nickname on every server.  Wildcards are
07 =ADMIN::allowed in the nickname.  Please use this CAREFULLY.

[OPERSERV/UNQLINE]
01 =ADMIN::UNQLINE <mask>
02 =ADMIN::
03 =ADMIN::This will remove a quarantine on a nickname set by
04 =ADMIN::the QULINE command.  You must specify the exact mask

06 =ADMIN::may obtain this with a /STATS Q command.

[OPERSERV/NOOP]
01 =ADMIN::NOOP <server> <ON|OFF>
02 =ADMIN::
03 =ADMIN::This will attempt to force all IRC Operators on a
04 =ADMIN::specified server to be forced LOCAL OPER ONLY.  This
05 =ADMIN::should be used with EXTREME caution, and only when
06 =ADMIN::a large number of opers (or the admin) on that server
07 =ADMIN::are breeching the network policy.  If you use this
08 =ADMIN::without a very good reason, it is likely your server
09 =ADMIN::will be delinked.

[OPERSERV/KILL]
01 =ADMIN::KILL <nickname> <reason>
02 =ADMIN::
03 =ADMIN::This will 'silently' kill a user from the network.
04 =ADMIN::ie. there will be no "Killed ()" in the quit message,
05 =ADMIN::and the user will not know they have been killed, it
06 =ADMIN::will look as if the server kicked them off with the
07 =ADMIN::reason you specify.

[OPERSERV/HIDE]
01 =ADMIN::HIDE <nickname> <new-host>
02 =ADMIN::
03 =ADMIN::If the IRC server supports it, this will change a
04 =ADMIN::users host to whatever you specify.  This should be
05 =ADMIN::used with caution, as some IRC clients compare the
06 =ADMIN::address in a DCC request and what they are logged
07 =ADMIN::on as before establishing a DCC.

[OPERSERV/PING]
01 =OPER SOP::PING
02 =OPER SOP::
03 =OPER SOP::This will force services to ping all servers (used for
04 =OPER SOP::obtaining the figures in the BREAKDOWN command, and
05 =OPER SOP::to gauge how lagged it is from the network) immediately.
06 =OPER SOP::Normally all servers are pinged periodically anyway.

[OPERSERV/UPDATE]
01 =SADMIN::UPDATE
02 =SADMIN::
03 =SADMIN::This will force a save of the databases immediately.
04 =SADMIN::This is done automatically periodically.

[OPERSERV/SHUTDOWN]
01 =SADMIN::SHUTDOWN <reason>
02 =SADMIN::
03 =SADMIN::This will terminate services totally.  They will not
04 =SADMIN::restart unless you restart them manually.
05 =SADMIN::THIS SHOULD BE USED WITH EXTREME CAUTION!

[OPERSERV/RELOAD]
01 =SADMIN::RELOAD
02 =SADMIN::
03 =SADMIN::This will reload the config file for services.  This
04 =SADMIN::used to implement changes made in this config file.
05 =SADMIN::Services will squit and re-connect, or sign off and
06 =SADMIN::sign on clients as necessary (in most cases, it will
07 =SADMIN::not be necessary).

[OPERSERV/UNLOAD]
01 =SADMIN::UNLOAD <language>
02 =SADMIN::
03 =SADMIN::This will unload a language file from memory.  This
04 =SADMIN::language file will be re-loaded when it is first
05 =SADMIN::used again (which may mean immediately if you unload
06 =SADMIN::your own language).  This is used to implement
07 =SADMIN::changes to a language file.

[OPERSERV/JUPE]
01 =ADMIN::JUPE <server> [reason]
02 =ADMIN::
03 =ADMIN::This will create a phantom server connected to
04 =ADMIN::services, usually to stop the real server of the
05 =ADMIN::being able to link.  If you specify a reason, it
06 =ADMIN::will be used as the server description.  You may
07 =ADMIN::get rid of this phantom server by SQUITing it.

[OPERSERV/ON]
01 =SADMIN::ON <AUTO|LOG|MSG> [service]
02 =SADMIN::
03 =SADMIN::This turns processing back on again for the type
04 =SADMIN::specified.  AUTO will turn on events processing,
05 =SADMIN::LOG will re-activate the output log, and MSG will
06 =SADMIN::turn allow services to once again take messages
07 =SADMIN::from clients.  If a service is specified, it will
08 =SADMIN::turn on messages for that service (assuming it
09 =SADMIN::was turned OFF individually).  The service is
10 =SADMIN::ignored for anything but MSG.

[OPERSERV/OFF]
01 =SADMIN::OFF <AUTO|LOG|MSG> [service]
02 =SADMIN::
03 =SADMIN::This will turn off processing for the type specified.
04 =SADMIN::AUTO will turn off the events processing, LOG will
05 =SADMIN::stop the output log, and MSG will stop clients from
06 =SADMIN::being able to message servics.  If a service is
07 =SADMIN::specified, it will turn off messages for that service
08 =SADMIN::only.  The service is ignored for anythinb but MSG.
09 =SADMIN::Under any circumstance, IDENTIFY and ON will be
10 =SADMIN::available through this service.

[OPERSERV/HTM]
01 =SOP::HTM [ON|OFF|SET <value>]
02 =SOP::
03 =SOP::This will manipulate High Traffic Mode.  When services
04 =SOP::are in High Traffic Mode, certain core functions are
05 =SOP::disabled to try and save the amount of bandwidth
06 =SOP::generated by services (ie. to cut down responses).
07 =SOP::HTM is triggered automatically by the inbound traffic
08 =SOP::over a certain period of time being greater than our
09 =SOP::threshold of Kb/s inbound.  The sample time period
10 =SOP::increases while we stay in HTM, and HTM is turned off
11 =SOP::when we go below the threshold.  HTM may be forced ON
12 =SOP::or OFF with this command, and the threshold value may
13 =SOP::changed here.  The threshold value should be in
14 =SOP::Standard Space Format.

[OPERSERV/SETTINGS]
01 =OPER SOP::Services has many settings set with its configuration
02 =OPER SOP::file.  You may view these settings for informational
03 =OPER SOP::purposes (eg. find out how long a nickname lasts

[OPERSERV/AKILL]
01 =OPER SOP::Sometimes a user becomes so abusive, that it is better
02 =OPER SOP::for the network as a whole to kill them from it.  This
03 =OPER SOP::list facilitates this need.  All people who match the
04 =OPER SOP::masks on this list will be automatically killed.
05 =OPER SOP::

09 =OPER SOP::it will be used as the time to keep the Auto Kill in
10 =OPER SOP::effect (depending on access, there are various maximum
11 =OPER SOP::times specifiable).  If you do not specify a time, the
12 =OPER SOP::default will be used (see SETTINGS OTHER for this).
