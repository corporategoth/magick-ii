; --------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Throughout this file there are verious codes used for various
; purposed, from making it look prettier on IRC, to replacing
; the code with a value direct from Magick.  There are three
; tables listed below which outline the codes and their meanings.
;
; The C replacement codes are used to insert a value from Magick
; into the string.  These should NEVER be removed, they may be
; moved around, but NOT removed (if removed, results are very
; unpredictable!).  These are also known as 'live' codes.
;
; The IRC beautifying codes are generally accepted codes that
; have a certain function, on ALL IRC clients.  The codes listed
; are all 'control' codes, meaning you hold control then push
; the key listed to insert the code.
;
; The mIRC colour codes are here for convenience, but it is NOT
; recommended you use them, as there are alot of IRC clients
; (especially unix based) that will not be able to understand
; them and make the output unreadable.  When using these codes,
; to change just the foreground you use ^C# where # is the colour
; code.  For foreground and background, you use ^C#,#.  To reset
; the text back to 'no colour' you just use ^C.
;
; --------------------------------------------------------------
;
; C replacement codes:
;   %s = String         %c = Single Character
;   %d = Integer        %f = Numeric (with DP's)
;   %o = Octal          %x = Hexidecimal
;   %% = Literal %
; The DP in %f can be moved by telling it how many numbers
; are to appear before and after the DP.  eg. %3.2f for 3
; numbers before, and 2 after the decimal point.
;
; IRC beautifying codes:
;   ^B () = BOLD       - Make text between look brighter
;   ^_ () = UNDERLINE  - Underline text between
;   ^V () = REVERSE    - Switch foreground and background
;   ^O () = CANCEL     - Back to non-bold/underline/reverse
;   ^C () = COLOUR     - See below
;
; mIRC colour codes:
;   0 = White           8  = Yellow
;   1 = Black           9  = Bright Green
;   2 = Blue            10 = Cyan
;   3 = Green           11 = Bright Cyan
;   4 = Red             12 = Bright Blue
;   5 = Orange          13 = Bright Magenta
;   6 = Magenta         14 = Grey
;   7 = Bright Red      15 = Bright Grey
