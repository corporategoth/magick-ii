;
; --------------------------------------------------------------
;
; This file is split up into sections.  These sections are so
; that we can logically group responses together.  IF you change
; the section names, or the response 'tags' within them, then
; you will likely break Magick's resopnses.  IF you are a
; developer and adding new sections, please note that they may
; NOT have a '/' (forward-slash) or space in their name.
;
; Throughout this file there are verious codes used for various
; purposes, from making it look prettier on IRC, to replacing
; the code with a value direct from Magick.  There are three
; tables listed below which outline the codes and their meanings.
; All lines in this file starting with ';' are comments.  If your
; response string has leading spaces, you MUST put a '\' in front
; of the first space, else leading spaces are stripped.
;
; The C replacement codes are used to insert a value from Magick
; into the string.  These should NEVER be removed, they must also
; stay in the same ORDER as they are.  If they're removed or the
; order in which they appear is changed, the results are undefined.
; These are also known as 'live' or 'active' codes.
;
; The IRC beautifying codes are generally accepted codes that
; have a certain function, on ALL IRC clients.  The codes listed
; are all 'control' codes, meaning you hold control then push
; the key listed to insert the code.
;
; The mIRC colour codes are here for convenience, but it is NOT
; recommended you use them, as there are alot of IRC clients
; (especially unix based) that will not be able to understand
; them and make the output unreadable.  When using these codes,
; to change just the foreground you use ^C# where # is the colour
; code.  For foreground and background, you use ^C#,#.  To reset
; the text back to 'no colour' you just use ^C.
;
; --------------------------------------------------------------
;
; C replacement codes:
;   %s = String         %c = Single Character
;   %d = Integer        %f = Numeric (with DP's)
;   %o = Octal          %x = Hexidecimal
;   %% = Literal %      %g = Like %f
; Please see the manual page on C formatting characters
; (included with Magick, or available with the command
; 'man format' or 'man formats' depending on the system).
; Briefly tho, if a number is specified in between the %
; and the letter, then it indicates the LENGTH of the
; field in question (usually its not recommended you change
; these).  If the number is negative, it forces it to be
; LEFT justified.  If the number has a decimal point, then
; it specifies how many digits appear AFTER the DP.
;
; IRC beautifying codes:
;   ^B () = BOLD       - Make text between look brighter
;   ^_ () = UNDERLINE  - Underline text between
;   ^V () = REVERSE    - Switch foreground and background
;   ^O () = CANCEL     - Back to non-bold/underline/reverse
;   ^C () = COLOUR     - See below
;
; mIRC colour codes:
;   0 = White           8  = Yellow
;   1 = Black           9  = Bright Green
;   2 = Blue            10 = Cyan
;   3 = Green           11 = Bright Cyan
;   4 = Red             12 = Bright Blue
;   5 = Orange          13 = Bright Magenta
;   6 = Magenta         14 = Grey
;   7 = Bright Red      15 = Bright Grey
