Magick has been worked on long and hard by the
Magick Development Team <devel@magick.tm>.

Please do us the curtesy of reading the documentation
we have provided to help you use Magick before coming
to us with queries about how to install or use it.
We do not mind questions, but only AFTER you have read

will more than likely be ignored if you try and ask
questions of us that are documented.
