    <h2><a name="what">What is SXP?</a></h2>

    <p>SXP stands for Simple XML Persistence, and is a quick-and-dirty C++
    library I threw together. It provides a simple (I hope) mechanism for
    enabling the objects in your application to persist themselves (i.e.
    read from and write to) to a XML file. It is built as a C++ wrapper
    around James Clark's excellent <a href= 
    "http://www.jclark.com/xml/expat.html"><em>expat</em></a> parser.</p>

    <p>SXP's major selling points are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>ease of use: a major design goal for it was adding XML
      persistence to a class to take around 2 line of code per class
      member (one for reading and one for writing). Efficiency concerns
      and C++ syntax quirks expanded this number to around 4 lines of code
      per class member (plus some fixed overhead); still, you should be
      able to add XML persistence to your classes in a minutes, rather
      than hours.</li>

      <li>efficiency: XML persistence via SXP adds to your persistable
      objects four virtual functions and no data members. If you need to
      support persisting of object references, you might need to add a
      single pointer to your objects. SXP can be used directly with all
      but the most lightweight of objects. SXP uses hash tables and works
      with one string compare ( <em>strcmp()</em> ) per XML tag in the
      input file. SXP reuses its internal objects from a pool to avoid
      constant allocation/deallocation of small objects.</li>

      <li>acceptable performance: SXP is more than fast enough for
      prototyping applications and even for small-to-medium
      production-level projects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="why">Why XML Persistence, Anyway?</a></h2>

    <p>If you are allergic towards industry buzzwords (like myself), you
    probably think XML is for consultants and "enterprise developers"
    (whatever that means), not for Real Programmers (like yourself).
    Still, I think XML is a Good Thing (TM), and is suitable not only for
    some multi-million dollar project with 5000 pages of design documents
    filled with UML and Booch notation, but also for the config files of
    your little pet project you're developing in your spare time, or for
    the document format of the application you're working on to in your
    [non-spare?!?] time. Here are a few reasons why I like XML:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>XML files are easy to view and easy to edit with a simple text
      editor - anything from Notepad to emacs will do. There are also
      several freely available XML editors, which make the task even
      easier - check out the "Buyer's Guide" section at <a href= 
      "http://xml.com">XML.com</a>. This means it will be easier to debug
      your save/load code. Ever had the problem when you write your save
      and load routines, and saving and loading a file definitely doesn't
      produce the same memory objects you started with? You have no idea
      whether the bug is in the save or the load routine, and spend 1 hour
      tracing the correct one. Not with XML: one look at the XML file
      itself can tell you if it's correct.</li>

      <li>XML files are open - anyone can read your XML files, process
      them, convert them with a XML parser or a few lines of Perl code.
      (If you still haven't picked up Perl, go ahead and spend 2-3 days to
      learn it. You'll thank me.) That "anyone" includes yourself after
      six months - if you're like me, after 6 months you won't know
      anything about the code you're happily hacking at today, including
      how to read its data files. You can find XML parsers for all kinds
      of environments and programming languages.</li>

      <li>XML files are high-level - the parser and the support lib
      (something like SXP) will take care of handling primitive data types
      like numbers and strings, and you'll never have the joy again of
      having to store the string length before the string itself (brrr...)
      Still, XML files are more compact than most high-level alternatives
      (I've used MS OLE IPropertyBags, stored in OLE structured storage
      files, which definitely incur more overhead).</li>

      <li>Disk space is ultra-cheap today, so the overhead of XML compared
      to binary files can be safely ignored in most cases. (In the rest of
      the cases, you're looking at more data than you can handle without a
      database engine.)</li>

      <li>XML is simple to use. The special case of using XML for object
      persistence is made even more simple with SXP.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="platform">Platform &amp; Performance</a></h2>

    <p>SXP was developed on Win32 with Visual C++ 6.0 and tested with <a
    href="http://www.jclark.com/xml/expat.html">expat</a> 1.1. It uses
    heavily STL for strings and collections. If you have expat and STL on
    your system, you should be able to compile and use SXP - but I haven't
    really tried it. </p>
	<p><i>Update:</i> Thanks to Andrei Errapart for cleaning up the
	incompatibilities with GCC and preparing a GNU autoconf version
	for those on weird platforms, as well as building RPMs.
	</p>

    <p>SXP is meant for fast prototyping; it was easy to write, and it is
    easy to use. Its performance isn't what it would be if I didn't take
    the easy shortcut with STL strings and lists. If you decide to use SXP
    in a production-level application, you should probably rip off STL and
    replace it with your own custom string and list handling in static
    arrays. Quick profiling has shown that when handling large
    multimegabyte XML files SXP spends about 30% of its time in <em>
    expat</em>, 55-60% in the STL support routines and only 10-15% in the
    SXP code itself. Moral: you can get it to run much, much faster, if
    you need.</p>

    <p>Still, SXP is not too slow to be unusable: for example, reading a 5
    MB XML file describing the structure of a graph with 1000 nodes and
    100 000 connections between them (see the second example below) takes
    less then 4 seconds on my 450 MHz Celeron. This comes to show that,
    first, with today's CPUs you can get away with being lazy and using
    STL, and, second, <em>expat</em> is a darn good parser.</p>

    <h2><a name="download">Download latest version</a></h2>

    <p>The latest version of SXP is 0.061. You can choose from three
	packages:
	<ul>
	<li><a href="sxp-0.061.zip">sxp-0.061.zip</a> (18 KB) - just the source
	files, makes a reasonably good attempt at self-configuration, works
	ok for Win32/MSVC++ and linux/gcc.</li>
	<li><a href="sxp-0.06.tar.gz">sxp-0.06.tar.gz</a> (127 KB) - 
	source files + GNU autoconf script, should work "everywhere" GNU autoconf
	works.</li>
	<li><a href="sxp-0.06-1.i386.rpm">sxp-0.06-1.i386.rpm</a> (78 KB) - 
	RPM for Linux-IA/32.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

    <p>You will need to download <a href= 
    "ftp://ftp.jclark.com/pub/xml/expat.zip"><em>expat</em></a> first.</p>

    <p>The "simple" archive contains the following files:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="sxp.h">sxp.h</a>, <a href="sxp.cpp">sxp.cpp</a>, <a
      href="sxp_data.h">sxp_data.h</a> - SXP itself. You only need this to
      use SXP. Please forgive my Microsoftish naming habits :-)</li>

      <li><a href="config.cpp">config.cpp</a>, <a href="config.xml">
      config.xml</a> - a simple example of using SXP to store
      configuration information (or user preferences, if you like) in an
      XML file.</li>

      <li><a href="graph.cpp">graph.cpp</a>, <a href="graph.xml">
      graph.xm</a>l - a bit more complicated example of using SXP to store
      a more complex data structure (a graph), illustrates a possible
      technique for persisting object references.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To build the examples, you will need the following files from the
    <em>expat</em> distribution:<br>
     <strong>xmltok.dll, xmlparse.dll, xmlparse.lib,
    xmlparse.h</strong><br>
     <strong>xmlparse.lib</strong> and <strong>xmlparse.h</strong> must be
    in the same directory where <strong>sxp.h</strong> is located; the two
    <strong>.dll</strong> files must be located in the directory where you
    execute your own program. To cut a long story short, just unzip the
    SXP archive in a directory of your choice, copy the four expat files
    there too, and create your Visual C++ workspace and project there.</p>

    <p>You will need to redistribute the two <strong>.dll</strong> files
    from expat with your application if you use SXP.</p>

    <h2><a name="changes">Revision history:</a></h2>

    <p><b>0.061</b></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Cleaned up incompatibilities with GCC, GNU autoconf support
	  courtesy of Andrei Errapart. You can choose from three
	  versions now: The basic version, guaranteed to work on Win32/MSVC++
	  and linux/GCC, the TGZ version with all the GNU autoconf machinery
	  inside it for all the others, and a RPM for Linux/IA-32.</li>
    </ul>
	
    <p><b>0.06</b></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Unicode output/input via UTF-8 (only for character data, tags
      and attribute names can be ASCII IMHO).</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>0.05</b></p>

    <p> All in all, from a user class point of view, only one thing has
    changed: recursive invocation when outputting XML is done with
    WriteSubElement, not with WriteElement.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>reading of simple data types from char * and fprintf-ing of said
      data types in FP segregated into separate classes and into a new
      file; this provides a single place to add data converters</li>

      <li>hashtable moved to singleton object instead of all-static class
      because of problems with order of construction of global objects
      (more specifically, tags which are static members in user
      classes)</li>

      <li>virtual function calls removed where possible with "class C:
      B&lt;C&gt;" trick</li>

      <li>inlining introduced in gross quantities</li>

      <li>a bunch of minor bugs fixed</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>0.04</b></p>

    <h2><a name="disclaimer">Disclaimer and License</a></h2>

    <p>SXP has not been extensively tested. It worked on all the test
    examples I wrote, a modification of it works inside a commercial
    application I'm working on, but I can't guarantee it will work for
    you. If it crashes your system, deletes or corrupts your data, and
    destroys your personal life, it's not my fault - you've been warned.
    Proceed at your own risk.</p>
