Magick is designed and developed by the Magick Development
Team <magick-devel@magick.tm>.  Any bugs, feature requests,
comments, etc should be directed at this mailing list.  The
development team is an OPEN team, however certain skills
are required to join, not the least of which is the ability
to program in C and C++, and to use CVS.  To join this team,
please e-mail prez@magick.tm for further details.

The Magick Alpha Team <magick-alpha@magick.tm> test current
development versions of Magick, finding not only bugs, but
also making sure it is a user friendly and understandable
product, so it may be changed at the same time its being
designed if needs be (rather than going back and re-writing
it).  The alpha team is an OPEN testing team, and you may
join it by first downloading and installing/setting up the
current alpha version of Magick (if you cannot do this on
your own, its recommended you do not join the alpha team),
and then e-mailing majordomo@magick.tm with "subscribe
magick-alpha" (no quotes, on one line).

The Magick Beta Team <magick-beta@magick.tm> test versions
of magick that have been through alpha testing, and are in
the final phase of development.  The beta team's main goal
is to find bugs before Magick is released, so they do not
get out into the release version of Magick.  The beta team
is an OPEN testing team, and you may join it by first down-
loading and installing/setting up the current beta version
of Magick, and then e-mailing majordomo@magick.tm with
"subscribe magick-beta" (no quotes, on one line).
