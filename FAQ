My IRCD isn't supported what can I do?
======================================

   If this is the case, and none of the pre-defined IRCD's are
compatible with it, please find out exactly (at a server to server
protocol level) how your IRCD is different to the ones Magick supports
(or ask the IRCD's author) and email the list of differences to the
Magick Development Team <magick-devel@magick.tm>.

Here are some of the IRCD's we know are compatible with ones supported:

IRCD                    COMPATIBLE

Wrecked IRCD            DALNet >= 4.4.15


I like these services and want to pay the author!
=================================================

   OK, so this isn't something I hear, but a little wishful thinking
never hurts.  If you want to send me something by snail mail, then
feel free to do so to PO BOX 893, SUTHERLAND, NSW, 2232, Australia.
I always like tokens of appreciation, puts a smile on my face and
makes the whole thing worth while (no, not necessarily money, but
that is always nice!).  Remember tho, if you ARE going to send me
money, don't send cash, and ensure it is cashable in Australia (an
international postal order is usually best).
