| FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS |
+----------------------------+

What is the Home Site of Magick?
================================

The Product home site is http://www.magick.tm
The Project home site is http://sourceforge.net/projects/magick

Whats the difference?  The Product site only really deals with telling
people about Magick, and giving them a place to download it.  There is
help on the site, and links, but most of the content is static (not
changing) unless there is a new version.  There IS a news section, but
this is more general news.

The Project site is where all bug tracking is done -- the newest (alpha
and beta) versions of the program are available from here, Forums for
which to discuss magick are hosted here, and a task list of what is to
be done in Magick is also contained on this site.  This site is very
dynamic and where you should go if you have questions, or problems
with magick -- or want to see whats coming up, or who is who.


My IRCD isn't supported what can I do?
======================================

   If this is the case, and none of the pre-defined IRCD's are
compatible with it, please find out exactly (at a server to server
protocol level) how your IRCD is different to the ones Magick supports
(or ask the IRCD's author) and email the list of differences to the
Magick Development Team <devel@magick.tm>.

Here are some of the IRCD's we know are compatible with ones supported:

IRCD                    COMPATIBLE
------------------------------------------------
Wrecked IRCD            DALNet >= 4.4.15


I like these services and want to pay the author!
=================================================

   OK, so this isn't something I hear, but a little wishful thinking
never hurts.  If you want to send me something by snail mail, then
feel free to do so to PO BOX 893, SUTHERLAND, NSW, 2232, Australia.
I always like tokens of appreciation, puts a smile on my face and
makes the whole thing worth while (no, not necessarily money, but
that is always nice!).  Remember tho, if you ARE going to send me
money, don't send cash, and ensure it is cashable in Australia (an
international postal order is usually best).
