Known problems that exist in magick that should be fixed.
This is devided into 3 sections.
- Possible bugs (ie. ones that are theoretically bugs but
  have not shown any impact or bugs that could not be
  reproduced or verified).
- Universal bugs (ie. ones that affect all implementations
  of magick, not just on one system, etc).
- System Specific bugs (ie. ones that only occur on certain
  systems, be it due to the OS, processor(s), memory, etc).

POSSIBLE (not proven)
--------

- Probably should lock when doing list searches (iterator
  based operations).  Doesnt seem a problem right now.
- Should probably lock when setting/getting CFG vals, just
  incase one is set while another thread is accessing it
  (though this possibility is VERY slim).
- Might later want to enable the mstring locking (tho now
  it doesnt seem to be causing a problem).

UNVERSAL
--------

- If you add someone to a committee that is head of one they
  are already on (eg. adding to ADMIN when they're already
  on OPER) it will not remove them from the subcommittee,
  and they will appear twice.

SYSTEM SPECIFIC
---------------
