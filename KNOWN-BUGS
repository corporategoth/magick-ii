Known problems that exist in magick that should be fixed.

- Probably should lock when doing list searches (iterator
  based operations).  Doesnt seem a problem right now.
- Should probably lock when setting/getting CFG vals, just
  incase one is set while another thread is accessing it
  (though this possibility is VERY slim).
