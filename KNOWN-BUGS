Known problems that exist in magick that should be fixed.

* No real locking, need to start locking everything
  - MLOCK and RLOCK/WLOCK are incompatable.  Use one or
    the other.  Mainly coz these are implemeted differently
    depending on thread library used, and revision of it.
  - Probably should lock when doing list searches (iterator
    baed operations).
