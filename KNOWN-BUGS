Known problems that exist in magick that should be fixed.

UNVERSAL
--------

- Probably should lock when doing list searches (iterator
  based operations).  Doesnt seem a problem right now.
- Should probably lock when setting/getting CFG vals, just
  incase one is set while another thread is accessing it
  (though this possibility is VERY slim).
- If you add someone to a committee that is head of one they
  are already on (eg. adding to ADMIN when they're already
  on OPER) it will not remove them from the subcommittee,
  and they will appear twice.
- Might later want to enable the mstring locking (tho now
  it doesnt seem to be causing a problem).
