Known problems that exist in magick that should be fixed.

* CS ACCESS DEL allows you to remove ANYONE on list

* CS ACCESS ADD does not check if the user is >= you when changing

* CS AKICK ADD does not check to see if your akicking a user >= you
  on the access list (or someone matching it currently in channel).

* No real locking, need to start locking everything
  - BUG in ACE locking, there is a max char length on locks, must
    make locks get set as 'Last X chars of lock string'.
