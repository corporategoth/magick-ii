Known problems that exist in magick that should be fixed.

UNVERSAL
--------

- Probably should lock when doing list searches (iterator
  based operations).  Doesnt seem a problem right now.
- Should probably lock when setting/getting CFG vals, just
  incase one is set while another thread is accessing it
  (though this possibility is VERY slim).
- It will segfault if we lose connection to server and
  try to re-establish it.
- If you add someone to a committee that is head of one they
  are already on (eg. adding to ADMIN when they're already
  on OPER) it will not remove them from the subcommittee,
  and they will appear twice.

SYSTEM SPECIFIC
---------------

FreeBSD (3.x, 4.x):

- The log file is not appended to properly, it is overwritten
  from the start - requiring a remove of the log file each
  restart (which is annoying!).
- Under high loads, it seems the underlying strings library
  of FreeBSD gives way and failes on initialising a string,
  causing either a coredump, or a recursive signal (spinlock).

Mandrake Linux:

- The threads system sometimes fails (coredumps) on an attempt
  to suspend a thread (probably a bad threads implementation).
